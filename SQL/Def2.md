## **1. What is a Database?**

A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
Think of it as a **digital filing cabinet** where information is stored in a structured way so it can be retrieved quickly.

* **Examples of data stored**: customer info, sales transactions, student records, product inventory.
* **Forms of databases**: text files, spreadsheets, relational tables, NoSQL collections, graph data.

**Key Points:**

* Stores data persistently.
* Can be structured (tables) or unstructured (documents, images, etc.).
* Needs a software layer to interact with it efficiently — that’s where **DBMS** comes in.

## **2. Database vs DBMS**

| Feature        | Database                                          | DBMS                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | The actual **collection of data**                 | The **software** that manages and interacts with the database    |
| **Function**   | Stores raw data                                   | Provides tools to insert, update, delete, query, and manage data |
| **Example**    | A folder full of `.csv` files or `.sql` data dump | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database                               |
| **Dependency** | Cannot work alone for large systems               | Requires a database to store data                                |
| **Analogy**    | Books in a library                                | Librarian who helps you find, add, and organize books            |

---

## **3. DBMS vs RDBMS**

| Feature            | DBMS (Database Management System)                      | RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Storage**   | Stores data as files (hierarchical, network, document) | Stores data in **tables (rows & columns)**                                         |
| **Relationships**  | May not support relationships between data             | Supports relationships via **primary & foreign keys**                              |
| **Data Structure** | Can be unstructured or semi-structured                 | Strictly **structured and relational**                                             |
| **Examples**       | Microsoft Access, MongoDB (NoSQL DBMS)                 | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server                                              |
| **Normalization**  | Not always supported                                   | Supports **normalization** to reduce redundancy                                    |
| **Transactions**   | May not follow ACID properties                         | Always follows **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) |

## **4. Other Available Types of Databases**

Different projects need different database types:

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)** – Data stored in tables with fixed schemas.
   Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

2. **NoSQL Databases** – Flexible schema, often used for big data or real-time apps.
   Types:

   * **Document-based**: MongoDB, CouchDB
   * **Key-Value**: Redis, DynamoDB
   * **Column-oriented**: Cassandra, HBase
   * **Graph databases**: Neo4j, ArangoDB

3. **In-memory Databases** – Extremely fast, stores data in RAM.
   Examples: Redis, Memcached.

4. **Time-series Databases** – Optimized for timestamped data.
   Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.

5. **Cloud Databases** – Fully managed by cloud providers.
   Examples: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Spanner, Azure SQL Database.

## **5. SQL vs PostgreSQL**

| Feature            | SQL                                                                                                   | PostgreSQL                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | SQL (**Structured Query Language**) is a standard language for interacting with relational databases. | PostgreSQL is a **specific RDBMS** that uses SQL (and has its own extensions).            |
| **Purpose**        | Language to query, insert, update, and delete data.                                                   | A database engine that stores, manages, and retrieves data using SQL.                     |
| **Example**        | `SELECT * FROM users;` is an SQL command.                                                             | PostgreSQL runs that command and returns the result.                                      |
| **Scope**          | A language standard used in many RDBMSs (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).                              | One particular open-source, advanced SQL-compliant RDBMS.                                 |
| **Extra Features** | N/A — just a language                                                                                 | Supports JSON data, full-text search, custom functions, advanced indexing, GIS (PostGIS). |

---


Let’s go step-by-step so the differences are crystal clear.

---

## **1. Database**

A **database** is the **entire collection of data** stored in a structured way.
It contains **tables, schemas, views, functions, indexes**, and more.
Think of it as the **whole house** where data lives.

**Example:**
In a college system, you might have a database called `CollegeDB`.

Inside `CollegeDB`:

* Tables: `Students`, `Courses`, `Teachers`
* Views: `ActiveStudentsView`
* Functions: `CalculateGrade()`
* Schemas: `public`, `admin`

---

## **2. Table**

A **table** is a **structured set of data** inside a database, arranged in **rows** and **columns**.
Each table stores data about one specific topic/entity.

**Example Table: `Students`**

| student\_id | name      | age | course\_id |
| ----------- | --------- | --- | ---------- |
| 1           | Ali Khan  | 21  | C101       |
| 2           | Sarah Ali | 22  | C102       |

**Key Points:**

* **Row (Record):** A single data entry (e.g., one student).
* **Column (Field):** A property of the data (e.g., `name`).

---

## **3. Schema**

A **schema** is like a **folder** inside a database that organizes related database objects (tables, views, functions, etc.).
It’s a **namespace** that prevents name conflicts and helps manage permissions.

**Example:**
In `CollegeDB`, you might have:

* **Schema `public`**: Contains general tables like `Students`, `Courses`.
* **Schema `admin`**: Contains sensitive tables like `Salaries`, `StaffLogin`.

So instead of just `Students`, you refer to it as:

* `public.Students`
* `admin.Salaries`

---

### **Analogy to Understand**

* **Database** = Whole library
* **Schema** = Section of the library (Science, History)
* **Table** = A single book in that section (all info on one topic)

---





---

## **1. Database Basics**

### **Create a Database**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydb;
```

### **Connect to a Database**

In **psql** (PostgreSQL terminal):

```sql
\c mydb;
```

### **List Databases**

```sql
\l
```

### **Drop a Database**

```sql
DROP DATABASE mydb;
```

⚠ **Note:** You can’t drop a database while connected to it.

---

## **2. CRUD Operations**

CRUD = **Create, Read, Update, Delete**
It’s the basic set of operations you do with data.

---

### **A. Create – New Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50)
);
```

**Explanation:**

* `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` → Auto-incremented unique ID.
* `VARCHAR(50)` → String up to 50 characters.
* `INT` → Integer number.

---

### **B. Insert Data**

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age, course)
VALUES ('Ali Khan', 21, 'Computer Science'),
       ('Sarah Ali', 22, 'Mathematics');
```

---

### **C. Read Data**

```sql
-- Read all data
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Read specific columns
SELECT name, course FROM students;

-- Read with condition
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 21;
```

---

### **D. Update Data**

```sql
UPDATE students
SET course = 'Data Science'
WHERE id = 1;
```

---

### **E. Delete Data**

```sql
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 2;
```

---

✅ **Full Workflow Example**

```sql
-- Create DB
CREATE DATABASE school;

-- Connect
\c school;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO students (name, age, course)
VALUES ('Ali Khan', 21, 'CS'), ('Sarah Ali', 22, 'Math');

-- Read
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Update
UPDATE students SET age = 23 WHERE name = 'Sarah Ali';

-- Delete
DELETE FROM students WHERE name = 'Ali Khan';
```

# **1. Data Types**

A **data type** defines what kind of values a column can store. Choosing the right type ensures:

* Data is valid
* Storage is efficient
* Queries are fast

### Common PostgreSQL Data Types:

* **INTEGER (INT)** → Whole numbers (e.g., `1, 200, -50`).
* **SERIAL** → Auto-incrementing integer (good for IDs).
* **VARCHAR(n)** → Variable-length string up to `n` chars (e.g., `VARCHAR(50)`).
* **TEXT** → Unlimited-length string.
* **BOOLEAN** → `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
* **DATE** → Just date (e.g., `2025-08-16`).
* **TIMESTAMP** → Date + time (e.g., `2025-08-16 10:30:00`).
* **NUMERIC(p, s)** → Exact decimal with precision (e.g., money values like `1234.56`).

✅ **Why important?**
If you put a `name` in an `INT` column, it makes no sense. Data types enforce correctness.

---

# **2. Constraints**

Constraints are **rules** applied to columns to ensure data integrity.

Types of constraints:

* `PRIMARY KEY`
* `NOT NULL`
* `DEFAULT`
* `UNIQUE`
* `CHECK` (custom rules)
* `FOREIGN KEY` (relationship between tables)

---

# **3. PRIMARY KEY**

* A **unique identifier** for each row in a table.
* Must be **unique** and **NOT NULL**.
* A table can have **only one primary key** (but it can be made up of multiple columns).

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
```

Here:

* `id` is the **primary key** → no two rows can have the same `id`.

---

# **4. NOT NULL**

* Prevents a column from having `NULL` (empty) values.
* Ensures that the column always has meaningful data.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Here:

* `name` **must** always have a value.
* `department` can be empty (NULL is allowed).

---

# **5. DEFAULT**

* Assigns a default value if none is provided during insertion.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending'
);
```

If you insert a new order without specifying `status`, it will automatically be `'Pending'`.

---

# **6. SERIAL**

* A special PostgreSQL type for **auto-incrementing integers**.
* Behind the scenes:

  * Creates a **sequence** (counter).
  * Assigns next number automatically when you insert.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

If you insert rows:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name) VALUES ('Laptop');
INSERT INTO products (product_name) VALUES ('Mobile');
```

The `product_id` will automatically become `1, 2, 3...`

---

# **7. UNIQUE**

* Ensures that **all values in a column are different**.
* Unlike `PRIMARY KEY`, a table can have **multiple UNIQUE constraints**.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE
);
```

Here:

* No two users can have the same `email` or `phone`.

---

# **📌 Putting It All Together**

Example table using **all these concepts**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,                 -- Auto-increment unique identifier
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,            -- Name must always exist
    city VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'Unknown',   -- If no city given, default is 'Unknown'
    email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE              -- No duplicate emails allowed
);
```

---

Perfect 👍 You want to **create an Employee table** with multiple columns and insert the given sample data into it. Let’s structure it properly.

---

## **Step 1: Create the Table**

We’ll create columns for employee details:

* `emp_id` → Employee ID (**Primary Key, auto increment**)
* `fname` → First Name (**NOT NULL**)
* `lname` → Last Name (**NOT NULL**)
* `email` → Unique email (**UNIQUE**)
* `dept` → Department name
* `salary` → Employee salary
* `hire_date` → Date of joining

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    dept VARCHAR(50),
    salary NUMERIC(10,2),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

---

## **Step 2: Insert Sample Data**

Here’s the cleaned version of your dataset:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (fname, lname, email, dept, salary, hire_date)
VALUES
('Raj',    'Sharma', 'raj.sharma@example.com', 'IT',       50000, '2020-01-15'),
('Priya',  'Singh',  'priya.singh@example.com', 'HR',       45000, '2019-03-22'),
('Arjun',  'Verma',  'arjun.verma@example.com', 'IT',       55000, '2021-06-01'),
('Suman',  'Patel',  'suman.patel@example.com', 'Finance',  60000, '2018-07-30'),
('Kavita', 'Rao',    'kavita.rao@example.com', 'HR',       47000, '2020-11-10'),
('Amit',   'Gupta',  'amit.gupta@example.com', 'Marketing', 52000, '2020-09-25'),
('Neha',   'Desai',  'neha.desai@example.com', 'IT',       48000, '2019-05-18'),
('Rahul',  'Kumar',  'rahul.kumar@example.com','IT',       53000, '2021-02-14'),
('Anjali', 'Mehta',  'anjali.mehta@example.com','Finance',  61000, '2018-12-03'),
('Vijay',  'Nair',   'vijay.nair@example.com', 'Marketing', 50000, '2020-04-01');
```

---

## **Step 3: Verify Data**

Check if everything inserted correctly:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

You should see a nice table like:

| emp\_id | fname  | lname  | email                                                       | dept      | salary | hire\_date |

---

👉 Do you want me to also give you **practice queries** (like finding highest salary, employees in IT dept, hired after 2020, etc.) so you can practice `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` on this dataset?

## 🔹 What are Clauses?

Clauses in SQL are conditions or instructions that modify how data is retrieved, inserted, updated, or deleted from a database.
Think of them as **filters or modifiers** you add to SQL queries to control the output.

---

## 1️⃣ **WHERE Clause**

👉 Used to filter records based on a condition.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept = 'IT';
```

* This will return only employees who are in the **IT department**.

🔎 You can use operators like `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `<>` (not equal), `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE dept = 'IT' AND salary > 50000;
```

✅ Filters IT employees with salary greater than 50,000.

---

## 2️⃣ **DISTINCT Clause**

👉 Removes duplicate values from the result set.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT dept FROM employees;
```

* If multiple employees belong to IT, HR, Finance, etc., you will see **each department only once**.

---

## 3️⃣ **ORDER BY Clause**

👉 Sorts the result set in ascending (default) or descending order.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT fname, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary ASC;
```

* Lists employees by salary in **ascending order**.

```sql
SELECT fname, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

* Lists employees by salary in **descending order**.

---

## 4️⃣ **LIMIT Clause**

👉 Restricts the number of rows returned.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 5;
```

* Shows only **first 5 employees**.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3;
```

* Shows **top 3 highest-paid employees**.

---

## 5️⃣ **LIKE Clause**

👉 Used for pattern matching with wildcards.

* `%` → Matches any number of characters.
* `_` → Matches exactly one character.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE fname LIKE 'A%';
```

* Finds employees whose first name starts with **A** (e.g., Arjun, Amit, Anjali).

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE fname LIKE '_a%';
```

* Finds employees where the **second letter** is "a" (e.g., Kavita, Suman).

---

## 🔹 Other Useful Clauses

### **BETWEEN**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 45000 AND 55000;
```

* Finds employees with salary between **45k and 55k**.

---

### **IN**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept IN ('IT', 'Finance');
```

* Gets employees from IT or Finance.

---

### **IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE email IS NULL;
```

* Finds employees without an email address.

---

✅ So far, you learned:

* `WHERE` → Filter rows
* `DISTINCT` → Remove duplicates
* `ORDER BY` → Sorting
* `LIMIT` → Restrict rows
* `LIKE` → Pattern matching
* Extra: `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `IS NULL`

---

Got it 👍 Let’s go through the SQL operators **BETWEEN**, **IN**, **NOT IN**, and **IS NULL** one by one, with examples.

---

### 1. **BETWEEN**

* Used to filter values within a **range** (inclusive of both ends).
* Works with numbers, text (alphabetical range), and dates.

✅ Example: Employees with salary between 45,000 and 55,000

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, salary
FROM employee
WHERE salary BETWEEN 45000 AND 55000;
```

✅ Example: Employees hired between 2020-01-01 and 2021-12-31

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, hire_date
FROM employee
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
```

---

### 2. **IN**

* Used to match a column against **multiple values**.
* Instead of writing multiple OR conditions, use `IN`.

✅ Example: Employees in IT or HR departments

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, dept
FROM employee
WHERE dept IN ('IT', 'HR');
```

---

### 3. **NOT IN**

* Opposite of `IN`, it excludes the listed values.

✅ Example: Employees not in Finance or Marketing

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, dept
FROM employee
WHERE dept NOT IN ('Finance', 'Marketing');
```

⚠️ Note: If the list contains `NULL`, `NOT IN` may behave unexpectedly (returns nothing). To avoid this, ensure the values don’t include `NULL`.

---

### 4. **IS NULL**

* Used to find rows where a column has no value (`NULL`).

✅ Example: Employees without email

```sql
SELECT fname, lname
FROM employee
WHERE email IS NULL;
```

✅ Example: Employees with missing salary

```sql
SELECT fname, lname
FROM employee
WHERE salary IS NULL;
```

---

### 5. **IS NOT NULL**

* Opposite of `IS NULL`, finds rows where a column has a value.

✅ Example: Employees with email filled

```sql
SELECT fname, lname
FROM employee
WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
```

---

🔥 Quick Comparison:

* `BETWEEN`: For ranges (`salary BETWEEN 40k AND 50k`)
* `IN`: For multiple values (`dept IN ('IT','HR')`)
* `NOT IN`: For excluding multiple values
* `IS NULL`: For missing values

---
Perfect 👍 Let’s go deep into **`OFFSET`** in PostgreSQL.

---

## 🔹 What is `OFFSET`?

* `OFFSET` is used to **skip a specific number of rows** before starting to return rows.
* It is usually combined with `LIMIT` for **pagination** (getting results in smaller chunks).

---

## 🔹 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table_name
ORDER BY some_column
LIMIT number_of_rows OFFSET number_of_rows_to_skip;
```

---

## 🔹 Example Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  department VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO employees (name, department) VALUES
('Ravi', 'HR'),
('Asha', 'Finance'),
('Kiran', 'IT'),
('Meena', 'IT'),
('Suresh', 'Marketing'),
('Anita', 'HR'),
('Vikas', 'Finance'),
('Deepa', 'IT');
```

Now table looks like:

| id | name   | department |
| -- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1  | Ravi   | HR         |
| 2  | Asha   | Finance    |
| 3  | Kiran  | IT         |
| 4  | Meena  | IT         |
| 5  | Suresh | Marketing  |
| 6  | Anita  | HR         |
| 7  | Vikas  | Finance    |
| 8  | Deepa  | IT         |

---

## 🔹 Examples with OFFSET

### 1. Get first 3 rows

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 3;
```

✅ Returns → Ravi, Asha, Kiran

---

### 2. Skip first 3 rows, get next 3

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;
```

✅ Returns → Meena, Suresh, Anita

---

### 3. Skip first 6 rows, get next 2

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 6;
```

✅ Returns → Vikas, Deepa

---

### 4. Pagination Example

Let’s say you want **2 employees per page**:

* **Page 1**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 0;
```

* **Page 2**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
```

* **Page 3**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 4;
```

* **Page 4**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 6;
```

---



---

Got it 👍
Let’s now focus only on **aggregate functions** in SQL:

PostgreSQL (and SQL in general) provides these aggregate functions:

---

### 1. **COUNT()**

* Counts the number of rows (or non-NULL values in a column).

```sql
-- Count all employees
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

-- Count employees in IT department
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE dept = 'IT';

-- Count how many have email (non-NULL only)
SELECT COUNT(email) FROM employees;
```

---

### 2. **SUM()**

* Adds up all numeric values in a column.

```sql
-- Total salary of all employees
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;

-- Total salary of HR department
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE dept = 'HR';
```

---

### 3. **AVG()**

* Returns the **average (mean)** of a numeric column.

```sql
-- Average salary
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;

-- Average salary of IT employees
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE dept = 'IT';
```

---

### 4. **MAX()**

* Returns the **highest value** in a column.

```sql
-- Highest salary
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;

-- Latest hire date
SELECT MAX(hire_date) FROM employees;
```

---

### 5. **MIN()**

* Returns the **lowest value** in a column.

```sql
-- Lowest salary
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;

-- Earliest hire date
SELECT MIN(hire_date) FROM employees;
```

---

✅ You can also **combine** aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
  SUM(salary) AS total_salary,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
  MAX(salary) AS highest_salary,
  MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees;
```

---




## 🔹 1. What is `GROUP BY`?

* `GROUP BY` is used to **group rows that have the same values in one or more columns**.
* It is usually used with **aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.

👉 Without `GROUP BY`, aggregate functions are applied to the **whole table**.
👉 With `GROUP BY`, aggregate functions are applied **per group**.

---

## 🔹 2. Example Table (Employee)

| emp\_id | fname  | dept      | salary |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| 1       | Raj    | IT        | 50000  |
| 2       | Priya  | HR        | 45000  |
| 3       | Arjun  | IT        | 55000  |
| 4       | Suman  | Finance   | 60000  |
| 5       | Kavita | HR        | 47000  |
| 6       | Amit   | Marketing | 52000  |
| 7       | Neha   | IT        | 48000  |
| 8       | Rahul  | IT        | 53000  |
| 9       | Anjali | Finance   | 61000  |
| 10      | Vijay  | Marketing | 50000  |

---

## 🔹 3. Basic Aggregate without `GROUP BY`

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee;
```

👉 Gives the **average salary of all employees**.

---

## 🔹 4. Aggregate with `GROUP BY`

```sql
SELECT dept, AVG(salary) 
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept;
```

👉 Groups employees by department, then calculates average salary **per department**.

📌 Output:

| dept      | avg\_salary |
| --------- | ----------- |
| IT        | 51500       |
| HR        | 46000       |
| Finance   | 60500       |
| Marketing | 51000       |

---

## 🔹 5. Using `COUNT()`

```sql
SELECT dept, COUNT(*) 
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept;
```

👉 How many employees in each department.

📌 Output:

| dept      | count |
| --------- | ----- |
| IT        | 4     |
| HR        | 2     |
| Finance   | 2     |
| Marketing | 2     |

---

## 🔹 6. Using `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`

* `HAVING` works like `WHERE`, but for groups.

```sql
SELECT dept, AVG(salary)
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

👉 Show only departments where avg salary > 50,000.

📌 Output:

| dept    | avg\_salary |
| ------- | ----------- |
| IT      | 51500       |
| Finance | 60500       |

---

## 🔹 7. When to **Skip `GROUP BY`**

You don’t need `GROUP BY` when:

1. You are selecting **only one group (whole table)**. Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee;
   ```

   👉 Highest salary in the entire company (no grouping needed).
2. You don’t use aggregate functions at all. Example:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employee WHERE dept = 'IT';
   ```

---
I see you’ve uploaded an image showing **SQL string functions**.
Here’s a breakdown of each one with examples:

---

### 🔹 String Functions in SQL

1. **`CONCAT`, `CONCAT_WS`**

   * `CONCAT` → Joins strings together.
   * `CONCAT_WS` → Joins strings with a separator.

   ```sql
   SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;
   SELECT CONCAT_WS('-', '2025', '08', '16');  -- Output: 2025-08-16
   ```

2. **`SUBSTR` (or `SUBSTRING`)**

   * Extracts part of a string.

   ```sql
   SELECT SUBSTR('Database', 1, 4);  -- Output: 'Data'
   ```

3. **`LEFT`, `RIGHT`**

   * Extracts characters from left or right.

   ```sql
   SELECT LEFT('Database', 4);   -- 'Data'
   SELECT RIGHT('Database', 4);  -- 'base'
   ```

4. **`LENGTH`**

   * Returns length of a string.

   ```sql
   SELECT LENGTH('Database');  -- 8
   ```

5. **`UPPER`, `LOWER`**

   * Changes case of text.

   ```sql
   SELECT UPPER('hello');  -- 'HELLO'
   SELECT LOWER('WORLD');  -- 'world'
   ```

6. **`TRIM`, `LTRIM`, `RTRIM`**

   * Remove spaces.

   ```sql
   SELECT TRIM('   hello   ');   -- 'hello'
   SELECT LTRIM('   hello');     -- 'hello'
   SELECT RTRIM('hello   ');     -- 'hello'
   ```

7. **`REPLACE`**

   * Replaces part of a string.

   ```sql
   SELECT REPLACE('I like SQL', 'SQL', 'PostgreSQL');  
   -- 'I like PostgreSQL'
   ```

8. **`POSITION`**

   * Finds position of a substring.

   ```sql
   SELECT POSITION('base' IN 'Database');  -- 5
   ```

9. **`STRING_AGG`** (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)

   * Concatenates values with a separator (like GROUP\_CONCAT in MySQL).

   ```sql
   SELECT STRING_AGG(first_name, ', ') FROM employees;
   -- 'Alice, Bob, Charlie'
   ```

---


---

**1. Find Different types of departments in database**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```

---

**2. Display records with High-low salary (Descending order)**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

---

**3. How to see only top 3 records from a table?**
👉 In **PostgreSQL / MySQL**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
LIMIT 3;
```

👉 In **Oracle (using ROWNUM)**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE ROWNUM <= 3;
```

---

**4. Show records where first name starts with letter 'A'**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%';
```

---

**5. Show records where length of the last name is 4 characters**
👉 PostgreSQL / MySQL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE LENGTH(last_name) = 4;
```

👉 Oracle

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE LENGTH(last_name) = 4;
```

---

✅ These queries use the functions from your image (`LENGTH`, `LIKE`, etc.).

Do you want me to also show the **string function usage** (e.g., `CONCAT`, `SUBSTR`, `UPPER`) in similar question-style examples?

Perfect 👍 These are **aggregate function queries** in SQL. I’ll write them clearly one by one:

---

**1. Find Total no. of employees in database**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees;
```

---

**2. Find no. of employees in each department**

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS no_of_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

---

**3. Find lowest salary paying**

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees;
```

---

**4. Find highest salary paying**

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees;
```

---

**5. Find total salary paying in Loan department**

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary_loan_dept
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Loan';
```

---

**6. Average salary paying in each department**

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

---

⚡ These queries use **COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG** with/without `GROUP BY`.

Do you want me to also prepare **practice-style questions + answers** for string/date functions (like `UPPER`, `SUBSTR`, `NOW`) the same way?








Got it 👍 You’re asking about **`ALTER`** in SQL.
The `ALTER` statement is used when you want to **modify the structure of a table** after it has already been created.

Here are the most common uses of `ALTER`:

---

### 1. **Add a new column**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD COLUMN age INT;
```

👉 Adds a new column `age` of type `INT`.

---

### 2. **Add multiple columns**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD (email VARCHAR(100), joining_date DATE);
```

---

### 3. **Modify/Change column datatype or size**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY salary DECIMAL(12,2);
```

👉 Changes the data type/size of `salary`.

*(In PostgreSQL / SQL Server it’s usually `ALTER COLUMN` instead of `MODIFY`)*

---

### 4. **Rename a column**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
RENAME COLUMN emp_name TO full_name;
```

---

### 5. **Drop (remove) a column**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP COLUMN age;
```

---

### 6. **Rename the table**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
RENAME TO staff;
```

---

### 7. **Add a constraint**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT salary_check CHECK (salary > 0);
```

---

### 8. **Drop a constraint**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP CONSTRAINT salary_check;
```

---


Got it 👍 Let’s make a **simple store database** with just two tables:

### 1. Customers Table

Holds customer information.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     -- Unique ID for each customer
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,       -- Customer's name
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE        -- Customer's email (unique)
);
```

---

### 2. Orders Table

Holds order information. Each order is linked to a customer using **foreign key**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,        -- Unique ID for each order
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,        -- Date of order
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,   -- Order amount
    customer_id INT,                 -- Refers to Customers table
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```

---

✅ Now the relationship is:

* One **customer** can have **many orders**.
* Each **order** belongs to exactly **one customer**.

Would you like me to also insert **sample data** into these tables so you can practice queries (like joins, counts, etc.)?

Perfect 👍 let’s add some **sample data** into the `Customers` and `Orders` tables, and then I’ll give you some **example queries** to practice.

---

### Insert Data

```sql
-- Insert Customers
INSERT INTO Customers (customer_id, name, email) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
(2, 'Bob', 'bob@example.com'),
(3, 'Charlie', 'charlie@example.com');

-- Insert Orders
INSERT INTO Orders (order_id, order_date, amount, customer_id) VALUES
(101, '2025-08-01', 250.00, 1),
(102, '2025-08-02', 150.50, 2),
(103, '2025-08-03', 320.75, 1),
(104, '2025-08-04', 80.00, 3),
(105, '2025-08-05', 500.00, 2);
```

---

### Example Queries

1. **Show all customers and their orders** (using `JOIN`):

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.amount, o.order_date
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

---

2. **Find total orders placed by each customer**:

```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name;
```

---

3. **Find total amount spent by each customer**:

```sql
SELECT c.name, SUM(o.amount) AS total_spent
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name;
```

---

4. **Find customers who have not placed any orders**:

```sql
SELECT c.name
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
```

---

5. **Get top 2 highest order amounts**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Orders
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

---
Perfect 👍 Let’s go **step by step** and understand **all types of SQL joins** using your `Customers` and `Orders` tables.
We’ll use the sample data we inserted earlier.

---

### 📌 Table Data Recap

**Customers**

| customer\_id | name    | email                                             |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | Alice   | [alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com)     |
| 2            | Bob     | [bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)         |
| 3            | Charlie | [charlie@example.com](mailto:charlie@example.com) |

**Orders**

| order\_id | order\_date | amount | customer\_id |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| 101       | 2025-08-01  | 250.00 | 1            |
| 102       | 2025-08-02  | 150.50 | 2            |
| 103       | 2025-08-03  | 320.75 | 1            |
| 104       | 2025-08-04  | 80.00  | 3            |
| 105       | 2025-08-05  | 500.00 | 2            |

---



Perfect 👍 Let’s go step by step and **define all SQL join operations in depth** with examples (using your `Customers` and `Orders` tables).

---

## 🔑 What is a JOIN?

* A **JOIN** is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them (usually a **foreign key → primary key** relation).
* In our case:

  * `Customers.customer_id` (Primary Key)
  * `Orders.customer_id` (Foreign Key)

---

## 1. **INNER JOIN**

**Definition:**

* Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
* If a customer has no order → not included.
* If an order does not belong to a valid customer → not included.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

✅ Only customers **with orders** will appear.

---

## 2. **LEFT JOIN** (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

**Definition:**

* Returns all rows from the **left table** (Customers), and matching rows from the right table (Orders).
* If a customer has no order → still shown, but order fields will be `NULL`.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

✅ Shows **all customers**, even those without any order.

---

## 3. **RIGHT JOIN** (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

**Definition:**

* Returns all rows from the **right table** (Orders), and matching rows from the left table (Customers).
* If an order has no valid customer → customer fields will be `NULL`.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

✅ Shows **all orders**, even if the customer record is missing.

---

## 4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**

**Definition:**

* Returns all rows when there is a match in **either** left (Customers) or right (Orders) table.
* If no match → NULLs are filled.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

✅ Combines `LEFT JOIN` + `RIGHT JOIN`.

---

## 5. **CROSS JOIN**

**Definition:**

* Returns the **Cartesian product** of two tables.
* Every row in Customers is combined with every row in Orders.
* Used rarely (mostly for testing or generating data).

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
CROSS JOIN Orders o;
```

✅ If 5 customers × 3 orders → **15 rows** result.

---

## 6. **SELF JOIN**

**Definition:**

* A join of a table with itself.
* Useful when comparing rows within the same table.

**Example:** (Find customers living in the same city)

```sql
SELECT c1.name AS customer1, c2.name AS customer2, c1.city
FROM Customers c1
JOIN Customers c2
ON c1.city = c2.city
AND c1.customer_id <> c2.customer_id;
```

✅ Finds pairs of customers in the same city.

---

⚡ **Summary of Joins:**

| Join Type      | What It Returns                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Only matching rows                       |
| **LEFT JOIN**  | All left table rows + matching right     |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | All right table rows + matching left     |
| **FULL JOIN**  | All rows from both tables (match or not) |
| **CROSS JOIN** | Cartesian product (all combinations)     |
| **SELF JOIN**  | Table joined with itself                 |

---




## 🔹 1. INNER JOIN

👉 Returns rows where **customers and orders match**.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | order\_id | amount |
| ------- | --------- | ------ |
| Alice   | 101       | 250.00 |
| Alice   | 103       | 320.75 |
| Bob     | 102       | 150.50 |
| Bob     | 105       | 500.00 |
| Charlie | 104       | 80.00  |

---

## 🔹 2. LEFT JOIN (Customers → Orders)

👉 Returns **all customers**, and their orders (if any).
If no orders → `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Result:** (same as inner join, but if we had a customer without orders, they would still appear)
Since all 3 customers have orders → no NULL here.
If we added `David` with no order, he would appear with `NULL`.

---

## 🔹 3. RIGHT JOIN (Orders → Customers)

👉 Returns **all orders**, and the customer details.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Result:** (same as inner join here, since all orders belong to a customer).

---

## 🔹 4. FULL OUTER JOIN

👉 Returns **all rows** from both tables.
If no match → `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Result:** (same as inner join here, because all customers have orders).
But if we had:

* A customer without orders → shows with `NULL` order values.
* An order with no matching customer → shows with `NULL` customer values.

---

## 🔹 5. CROSS JOIN

👉 Combines **every customer with every order** (cartesian product).
If `Customers = 3` and `Orders = 5` → result has `3 × 5 = 15` rows.

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM Customers c
CROSS JOIN Orders o;
```

**Result Example (partial):**

| name    | order\_id |
| ------- | --------- |
| Alice   | 101       |
| Alice   | 102       |
| Alice   | 103       |
| ...     | ...       |
| Charlie | 105       |

---

## 🔹 6. SELF JOIN (not common here but possible)

👉 Compare customers with themselves. Example: Find customers with the same email domain.

```sql
SELECT a.name AS customer1, b.name AS customer2, a.email
FROM Customers a
JOIN Customers b
ON a.email = b.email AND a.customer_id <> b.customer_id;
```

(Current data has unique emails, so result = empty set).

---

✅ Now you’ve seen **INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF JOIN** clearly with the store DB.

Would you like me to make a **practice set of 10 JOIN-based questions (exam style)** using just these two tables, with queries + expected output? That way you can master JOINs.














Got it 👍 Let’s simplify the schema with **fewer columns** while still showing a clear **foreign key relationship**:

---

### 1. `students` table

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

### 2. `courses` table

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

### 3. `enrollments` table (bridge table for many-to-many relation)

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,

    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);
```

---

Would you like me to also **insert sample data** + show **JOIN queries** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) using this simplified version?



Perfect 👌 since we made a **many-to-many relationship** between `students` and `courses` using the `enrollments` table, let’s add some sample data and then try out different **joins**.

---

## 1. Insert Sample Data

### Students

```sql
INSERT INTO students (student_id, student_name) VALUES
(1, 'Alice'),
(2, 'Bob'),
(3, 'Charlie');
```

### Courses

```sql
INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name) VALUES
(101, 'Math'),
(102, 'Science'),
(103, 'History');
```

### Enrollments (who enrolled in what)

```sql
INSERT INTO enrollments (enrollment_id, student_id, course_id) VALUES
(1, 1, 101),  -- Alice → Math
(2, 1, 102),  -- Alice → Science
(3, 2, 103),  -- Bob → History
(4, 3, 101);  -- Charlie → Math
```

---

## 2. Joins

### 🔹 INNER JOIN (only matching rows)

Get all students with their enrolled courses:

```sql
SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
FROM enrollments e
INNER JOIN students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
INNER JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

👉 Output:

```
Alice   | Math
Alice   | Science
Bob     | History
Charlie | Math
```

---

### 🔹 LEFT JOIN (all students, even if not enrolled)

```sql
SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
LEFT JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

👉 Shows all students. If a student has no course, `course_name` will be NULL.

---

### 🔹 RIGHT JOIN (all courses, even if no one enrolled)

```sql
SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
FROM students s
RIGHT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
RIGHT JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

👉 Shows all courses. If no student enrolled, `student_name` will be NULL.

---

### 🔹 FULL OUTER JOIN (all students + all courses)

```sql
SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
FROM students s
FULL OUTER JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
FULL OUTER JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

👉 Shows every student and every course, with NULL where there’s no match.

---




Great question 🚀 The diagram you uploaded already shows the **classic e-commerce schema**. Let’s write the **SQL implementation** with **one-to-many** and **many-to-many** relationships.

---

## 1. Create Tables

```sql
-- Customers Table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    cust_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- Orders Table (One-to-Many with Customers)
CREATE TABLE orders (
    ord_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ord_date DATE,
    cust_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customers(cust_id)
);

-- Products Table
CREATE TABLE products (
    p_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    p_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

-- Order_Items Table (Many-to-Many between Orders and Products)
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    items_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ord_id INT,
    p_id INT,
    quantity INT,

    FOREIGN KEY (ord_id) REFERENCES orders(ord_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (p_id) REFERENCES products(p_id)
);
```

---

## 2. Insert Sample Data

```sql
-- Customers
INSERT INTO customers VALUES 
(1, 'Alice'),
(2, 'Bob');

-- Orders
INSERT INTO orders VALUES 
(101, '2025-08-10', 1),
(102, '2025-08-12', 2);

-- Products
INSERT INTO products VALUES
(201, 'Laptop', 800.00),
(202, 'Phone', 500.00),
(203, 'Headphones', 50.00);

-- Order Items (Alice bought Laptop + Headphones, Bob bought Phone)
INSERT INTO order_items VALUES
(1, 101, 201, 1),
(2, 101, 203, 2),
(3, 102, 202, 1);
```

---

## 3. Query: Customers → Orders → Products

### Show each customer with their order details and product list:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.cust_name,
    o.ord_id,
    o.ord_date,
    p.p_name,
    p.price,
    oi.quantity,
    (p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_price
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.cust_id = o.cust_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.ord_id = oi.ord_id
JOIN products p ON oi.p_id = p.p_id;
```

---

✅ Example Output

| cust\_name | ord\_id | ord\_date  | p\_name    | price  | quantity | total\_price |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------------ |
| Alice      | 101     | 2025-08-10 | Laptop     | 800.00 | 1        | 800.00       |
| Alice      | 101     | 2025-08-10 | Headphones | 50.00  | 2        | 100.00       |
| Bob        | 102     | 2025-08-12 | Phone      | 500.00 | 1        | 500.00       |

---

👉 This setup shows:

* **One-to-Many** → A customer can have many orders.
* **Many-to-Many** → An order can have many products, and a product can appear in many orders (via `order_items`).

---






Got it 👍 Let’s continue with **Views** using the same simplified tables:

We already have:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);
```

---

## 1. What is a View?

* A **view** is a **virtual table** based on a query.
* It doesn’t store data itself, but shows results dynamically from the underlying tables.
* Think of it as a **saved SELECT query**.

---

## 2. Example Views

### 🔹 View: Students with their Courses

```sql
CREATE VIEW student_courses AS
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, c.course_name, e.enrollment_date
FROM students s
JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
```

Now you can query this like a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM student_courses;
```

---

### 🔹 View: Course Enrollment Count

```sql
CREATE VIEW course_enrollment_count AS
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_students
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id
GROUP BY c.course_name;
```

Usage:

```sql
SELECT * FROM course_enrollment_count;
```

---

### 🔹 View: Students Not Enrolled in Any Course

```sql
CREATE VIEW students_without_courses AS
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
WHERE e.course_id IS NULL;
```

---

## 3. Updating Through Views

* If the view is **simple** (from one table, no aggregates, no joins), you can `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` through it.
* If the view has **joins, aggregates, or GROUP BY**, it’s usually **read-only**.

---







Got it 👍 Let’s simplify and learn **HAVING clause** using your `students`, `courses`, and `enrollments` tables.

---

## 🔹 **What is `HAVING` Clause?**

* `WHERE` filters rows **before grouping**.
* `HAVING` filters groups **after grouping (with GROUP BY)**.

👉 Think of it like:

* Use `WHERE` for filtering rows.
* Use `HAVING` for filtering aggregated results.

---

## Example Data (from earlier inserts)

**students**

| student\_id | student\_name |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | Alice         |
| 2           | Bob           |
| 3           | Charlie       |

**courses**

| course\_id | course\_name |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 101        | Math         |
| 102        | Science      |
| 103        | History      |

**enrollments**

| enrollment\_id | student\_id | course\_id | enrollment\_date |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 1              | 1           | 101        | 2024-01-10       |
| 2              | 1           | 102        | 2024-01-11       |
| 3              | 2           | 101        | 2024-01-12       |
| 4              | 3           | 103        | 2024-01-15       |

---

## 🔹 Example 1: Count enrollments per student

```sql
SELECT s.student_name, COUNT(e.course_id) AS total_courses
FROM students s
JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
GROUP BY s.student_name;
```

👉 Output:

| student\_name | total\_courses |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Alice         | 2              |
| Bob           | 1              |
| Charlie       | 1              |

---

## 🔹 Example 2: Use `HAVING` to filter students with **more than 1 course**

```sql
SELECT s.student_name, COUNT(e.course_id) AS total_courses
FROM students s
JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
GROUP BY s.student_name
HAVING COUNT(e.course_id) > 1;
```

👉 Output:

| student\_name | total\_courses |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Alice         | 2              |

---

## 🔹 Example 3: Courses with at least 2 students

```sql
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_students
FROM courses c
JOIN enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id
GROUP BY c.course_name
HAVING COUNT(e.student_id) >= 2;
```

👉 Output:

| course\_name | total\_students |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Math         | 2               |

---

✅ So remember:

* `WHERE` → row filtering before grouping.
* `HAVING` → group filtering after aggregation.

---
Great question 👍 Let’s break down **ROLLUP** in SQL.

---

## 🔹 What is `ROLLUP`?

* `ROLLUP` is an extension of the **GROUP BY** clause.
* It **adds extra rows** to the result set to show **subtotals** and a **grand total**.
* It’s very useful for hierarchical aggregations (like totals per category, then overall total).

---

## 🔹 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY ROLLUP (column1, column2);
```

* `ROLLUP(column1, column2)` means:

  1. Group by `(column1, column2)`
  2. Group by `(column1)`
  3. Grand total (no group)

---

## 🔹 Example with your schema

Suppose we want to count **enrollments per course per student**, then per course, then overall.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.course_name,
    s.student_name,
    COUNT(e.enrollment_id) AS total_enrollments
FROM enrollments e
JOIN students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
GROUP BY ROLLUP (c.course_name, s.student_name);
```

---






Got it 👍 Let’s go step by step.

A **Stored Routine** in SQL is a set of SQL statements saved in the database so they can be reused.
There are two main types:

1. **Stored Procedure** → Performs an action (insert, update, delete, complex logic).
2. **Stored Function** → Returns a single value after performing some logic (used inside queries).

---

### 1. Stored Procedure (does not return value directly)

Example: Insert a new student into the `students` table.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE AddStudent(
    p_student_id INT,
    p_student_name VARCHAR,
    p_email VARCHAR
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO students (student_id, student_name, email)
    VALUES (p_student_id, p_student_name, p_email);
END;
$$;

```
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_emp_salary(

    p_employee_id INT,

    p_new_salary NUMERIC

)

LANGUAGE plpgsql

AS $$

BEGIN

    UPDATE employees

    SET salary = p_new_salary

    WHERE emp_id = p_employee_id;

END;

$$;


CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_employee(

    p_fname VARCHAR,

    p_lname VARCHAR,

    p_email VARCHAR,

    p_dept VARCHAR,

    p_salary NUMERIC

)

LANGUAGE plpgsql

AS $$

BEGIN

    INSERT INTO employees (fname, lname, email, dept, salary)

    VALUES (p_fname, p_lname, p_email, p_dept, p_salary);

END;

$$;
```
✅ To call it:

```sql
CALL AddStudent(101, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```

---

### 2. Stored Function (returns a value)

Example: Count how many courses a student has enrolled in.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION TotalCourses(p_student_id INT)
RETURNS INT AS $$
DECLARE
    total INT;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total
    FROM enrollments
    WHERE student_id = p_student_id;

    RETURN total;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;




CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dept_max_sal_emp1(dept_name VARCHAR)

RETURNS TABLE(emp_id INT, fname VARCHAR, salary NUMERIC) 

AS $$

BEGIN

    RETURN QUERY

    SELECT 

        e.emp_id,  e.fname, e.salary

    FROM 

        employees e

    WHERE 

        e.dept = dept_name

        AND e.salary = (

            SELECT MAX(emp.salary)

            FROM employees emp

            WHERE emp.dept = dept_name

        );

END;

$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


```

✅ To use it:

```sql
SELECT TotalCourses(1);
```

---

⚡ **Key Difference**:

* **Procedure** → Do something (Insert/Update/Delete). Called with `CALL`.
* **Function** → Return a single value. Used in `SELECT`.

---

Do you want me to also show **real-world many-to-many logic** with a **procedure** (like enrolling a student into a course with validations)?





Perfect timing 👌 — **Window Functions** are one of the most powerful features in SQL (Postgres, Oracle, MySQL 8+, etc.).

---

## 🔹 What is a Window Function?

A **window function** performs a calculation **across a set of rows that are related to the current row**, without collapsing rows into groups (unlike `GROUP BY`).

* It gives **row-by-row results**.
* Works with an **OVER() clause**.

---

## 🔹 General Syntax

```sql
function_name (expression) 
OVER (
    PARTITION BY column_name   -- like GROUP BY
    ORDER BY column_name       -- defines order of rows
)
```

---

## 🔹 Common Window Functions

1. **ROW\_NUMBER()** → Assigns unique number to each row in the partition.
2. **RANK()** → Rank with gaps (1, 2, 2, 4…).
3. **DENSE\_RANK()** → Rank without gaps (1, 2, 2, 3…).
4. **NTILE(n)** → Splits rows into *n* equal buckets.
5. **SUM() / AVG() / MIN() / MAX()** → Aggregate functions used as windows.
6. **LEAD() / LAG()** → Access next/previous row’s value.
7. **FIRST\_VALUE() / LAST\_VALUE()** → Pick first/last row in partition.

---

## 🔹 Example Table

`employees`

| emp\_id | emp\_name | dept | salary |
| ------- | --------- | ---- | ------ |
| 1       | A         | HR   | 50000  |
| 2       | B         | HR   | 60000  |
| 3       | C         | IT   | 70000  |
| 4       | D         | IT   | 90000  |
| 5       | E         | IT   | 80000  |

---

### 1. **ROW\_NUMBER()**

```sql
SELECT emp_name, dept, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
```

👉 Numbers employees in each dept by salary (highest = 1).

---

### 2. **RANK() vs DENSE\_RANK()**

```sql
SELECT emp_name, dept, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

* RANK leaves gaps if there are ties.
* DENSE\_RANK does not.

---

### 3. **Aggregate Window Function**

```sql
SELECT emp_name, dept, salary,
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept) AS avg_salary_in_dept
FROM employees;
```

👉 Shows each employee with their department’s average salary (without collapsing rows).

---

### 4. **LEAD() and LAG()**

```sql
SELECT emp_name, dept, salary,
       LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary) AS prev_salary,
       LEAD(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary
FROM employees;
```

👉 Compares each employee’s salary to previous and next in the department.

---

✅ In short:

* `GROUP BY` → aggregates and **reduces rows**.
* **Window functions** → keep all rows and **add extra calculations per row**.

---

Do you want me to show you the **window function solution** for your earlier query (*find employees in each department with maximum salary*)?





Got it 👍 Let’s break down **CTE (Common Table Expression)** in SQL step by step.

---

## **Definition**

A **CTE (Common Table Expression)** is a temporary result set defined using the `WITH` keyword, which you can reference within a single SQL query.
It makes queries **easier to read, modular, and reusable** (like creating a temporary view just for that query).

---

## **Syntax**

```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...)
AS (
    SELECT ...
)
SELECT *
FROM cte_name;
```

---

## **Example 1: Simple CTE**

Find employees with salary greater than 50,000.

```sql
WITH HighSalaryEmployees AS (
    SELECT employee_id, name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 50000
)
SELECT *
FROM HighSalaryEmployees;
```

Here:

* `HighSalaryEmployees` is the CTE.
* It exists only for that query execution.

---

## **Example 2: Using CTE with Aggregation**

Find the average salary in each department and list employees who earn more than the department average.

```sql
WITH DeptAvg AS (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT e.name, e.salary, e.department_id
FROM employees e
JOIN DeptAvg d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > d.avg_salary;
```

---

## **Example 3: Recursive CTE (Hierarchy / Tree Structures)**

Find employee hierarchy (manager → employee).

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    -- Anchor member (top manager)
    SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive member
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh
    ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT *
FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
```

This keeps going down the hierarchy until no more matches are found.

---

✅ **CTE vs Subquery**

* A **subquery** is inline and often harder to read.
* A **CTE** gives it a name, making the query modular and readable.
* CTEs can be recursive, subqueries cannot.

---

Do you want me to create a **shopping store CTE example** (using `customers`, `orders`, `products`, `order_items` you asked before) so you can see it in real use?



Perfect use case for **CTEs + window functions** 👌

Here’s how you can do it in **PostgreSQL**:

---

### ✅ Using **CTE**

```sql
WITH dept_avg AS (
    SELECT 
        department_id,
        AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.name,
    e.department_id,
    e.salary,
    d.avg_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_avg d 
    ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > d.avg_salary;
```

📌 **Explanation**:

* First, the CTE `dept_avg` computes the **average salary per department**.
* Then, we join it back with `employees` and filter employees whose salary is **greater than their department’s average**.

---

### ✅ Using **Window Function**

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    name,
    department_id,
    salary,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS dept_avg
FROM employees
WHERE salary > AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id);
```

📌 **Explanation**:

* `AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id)` gives the **average salary within each department** for every row.
* The `WHERE` filters out employees whose salary is **greater than that window average**.

---

👉 Both approaches give the same result.

* **CTE** is cleaner if you want step-by-step logic.
* **Window functions** are more compact and efficient for analysis queries.

Do you want me to also write this as a **stored procedure** in PostgreSQL that directly returns these employees?










Got it 👍 Let’s go step by step with **Triggers in PostgreSQL**.

---

## 🔹 **What is a Trigger?**

A **trigger** in PostgreSQL is a database callback function that automatically executes when a specified event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) happens on a table.
It helps enforce rules, maintain audit logs, or automate updates without manually writing queries.

---

## 🔹 **Syntax**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{ BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF } { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE }
ON table_name
[ FOR EACH ROW | FOR EACH STATEMENT ]
EXECUTE FUNCTION function_name();
```

📌 Key parts:

* **BEFORE** → Runs before the operation happens (can validate/modify).
* **AFTER** → Runs after the operation (good for logging/auditing).
* **FOR EACH ROW** → Runs once per affected row.
* **FOR EACH STATEMENT** → Runs once per query, regardless of affected rows.

---

## 🔹 **Steps to Create a Trigger**

1. Write a trigger function (`RETURNS trigger`).
2. Attach it to a table with `CREATE TRIGGER`.

---

## 🔹 Example 1: Audit Log on Salary Update

Suppose we want to **log every salary change** in an audit table.

### Step 1: Create Audit Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE salary_audit (
    audit_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT,
    old_salary NUMERIC,
    new_salary NUMERIC,
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Step 2: Create Trigger Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_salary_change()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO salary_audit(employee_id, old_salary, new_salary)
    VALUES(OLD.employee_id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Step 3: Create Trigger

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trg_salary_update
AFTER UPDATE OF salary ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (OLD.salary IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.salary)
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_salary_change();
```

📌 **What happens?**

* When an employee’s salary changes, the old and new values get stored in `salary_audit`.

---

## 🔹 Example 2: Enforce Business Rule

👉 Prevent salary from being updated to less than the old salary.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION prevent_salary_decrease()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.salary < OLD.salary THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Salary cannot be decreased for employee %', OLD.employee_id;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_prevent_salary_cut
BEFORE UPDATE OF salary ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_salary_decrease();
```

📌 **Result**: If you try to reduce someone’s salary → PostgreSQL throws an error.

---

⚡ Triggers are often used for:

* **Audit logging** (history of changes)
* **Validations / Business rules**
* **Auto-updates** (like updating a `last_modified` column)

---



**create a trigger in PostgreSQL** that ensures whenever an employee’s salary is updated, if it is less than 0, it should automatically be set to 0.

Here’s how you can implement it:

```sql
-- Step 1: Create the Trigger Function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_salary_not_negative()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- If new salary is less than 0, set it to 0
    IF NEW.salary < 0 THEN
        NEW.salary := 0;
    END IF;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Step 2: Create the Trigger on Employees Table
CREATE TRIGGER salary_check_trigger
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION check_salary_not_negative();
```

### 🔎 Explanation:

* **`BEFORE UPDATE`** → runs before the update happens.
* **`NEW.salary`** → refers to the new salary being updated.
* If it’s `< 0`, we reset it to **0**.
* The trigger applies **row by row** (`FOR EACH ROW`).

---

✅ Example:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = -5000
WHERE employee_id = 101;
```

After this update, the salary will automatically become **0**, not **-5000**.

---

Do you want me to also extend this trigger so that it works for both **INSERT** and **UPDATE** (so no negative salary is allowed at the time of adding a new employee too)?








Got it 👍 Let’s talk about **transactions** in PostgreSQL.

A **transaction** is a unit of work that ensures a group of SQL statements are executed as **all-or-nothing** (atomicity).

* If all statements succeed → changes are **committed**.
* If any statement fails → all changes are **rolled back** (undone).

---

### 🔹 Basic Transaction Example

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 5000
WHERE emp_id = 101;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary - 5000
WHERE emp_id = 102;

COMMIT;
```

* If both updates succeed → saved permanently.
* If second update fails → both updates rolled back.

---

### 🔹 With ROLLBACK

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = -10000   -- wrong update
WHERE emp_id = 101;

ROLLBACK;   -- undo the change
```

---

### 🔹 Savepoints inside a transaction

You can mark points and rollback only to that point:

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE employees SET salary = salary + 1000 WHERE emp_id = 101;

SAVEPOINT sp1;

UPDATE employees SET salary = salary / 0 WHERE emp_id = 102; -- error (divide by 0)

ROLLBACK TO sp1;  -- rollback only the second update

COMMIT;  -- first update still goes through
```

---

### 🔹 Transactions + Your Trigger

Since your trigger prevents negative salaries, even if a transaction tries to set `salary = -5000`,
the trigger changes it to `0` **before commit**.

Example:

```sql
BEGIN;

CALL update_emp_salary(101, -5000);  -- trigger sets it to 0

COMMIT;
```

Result → salary stored as `0`.

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to **wrap your `update_emp_salary` procedure inside a transaction** so that multiple updates can be done safely together?
