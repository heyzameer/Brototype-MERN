# üìò TypeScript Notes (Complete Guide 0 ‚Üí 100)

---

## 1. What is TypeScript?

*   **Definition**: TypeScript is an **open-source programming language** developed by Microsoft. It is a **superset of JavaScript**, meaning all valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript, but TypeScript adds features like **static typing, interfaces, generics, enums, access modifiers, and compile-time checking**.
*   **Explanation**: TypeScript code (`.ts`) is compiled (transpiled) into plain JavaScript (`.js`) because browsers and Node.js can only execute JavaScript. This compilation step is where TypeScript checks for type errors.
*   **Main Goal**: To detect **errors at compile time** (while you are coding) instead of at runtime (when the user is running the application).

**Example**:

```ts
let username: string = "Zameer";
username = 42; // ‚ùå Error at compile time: "Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'."
```

‚úÖ In plain JS, this would be allowed, and the error would only appear later at runtime if a string-specific method was called on `username`.

**Interview Qs & Answers**

*   **Q: What is TypeScript?**
    **A:** A superset of JavaScript with static typing and extra features, compiled into JavaScript.
*   **Q: Why is TypeScript called a superset of JavaScript?**
    **A:** Because it extends JavaScript with new features, but all valid JS code is also valid TS code.

---

## 2. Disadvantages of TypeScript

*   **Learning Curve**: Beginners may struggle with types, generics, and other advanced features not present in JavaScript.
*   **Compilation Step**: An extra build step is required to compile TypeScript into JavaScript before the code can be executed.
*   **Verbose Syntax**: Explicitly defining types can sometimes make the code longer and more verbose compared to plain JavaScript.
*   **Library Support**: While most popular JS libraries have type definitions, some smaller or older ones may not, requiring you to write your own or use them without type safety.


*   **Adantage**
Static Typing ‚Äì Catches errors at compile time

Improved Code Quality ‚Äì Types act as documentation, reduces bugs

Supports OOP ‚Äì Classes, interfaces, access modifiers, generics

Better IDE Support ‚Äì Autocomplete, hints, refactoring

Scalable ‚Äì Great for large codebases and team projects

Interoperable ‚Äì Works with existing JS libraries

Optional Strict Mode ‚Äì Enforces safer coding practices

**Interview Qs & Answers**

*   **Q: What are the drawbacks of TypeScript?**
    **A:** It requires an extra compilation step, has a steeper learning curve, can be more verbose, and occasionally lacks type definitions for third-party libraries.

---

## 3. Statically Typed Language

*   **Definition**: A statically typed language requires variable types to be **declared or inferred at compile time**. The compiler checks for type mismatches, catching errors before the code is ever run.
*   JavaScript is **dynamically typed** ‚Üí The type of a variable is checked and known only at runtime.
*   TypeScript is **statically typed** ‚Üí The type of a variable is known and checked at compile time.

**Example**:

```ts
let age: number = 25;
age = "twenty"; // ‚ùå Compile-time error
```

**Interview Qs & Answers**

*   **Q: What does statically typed mean?**
    **A:** It means variable types are checked at compile time, not runtime, which helps catch errors early.

---

## 4. Compiling a Project

*   **Installation**: Install the TypeScript compiler globally.

    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```

*   **Compilation**: Compile a single file.

    ```bash
    tsc index.ts
    ```

    **Explanation**: This command generates an `index.js` file from your `index.ts` file.

*   **Watch Mode**: Automatically re-compile the file when changes are saved.

    ```bash
    tsc index.ts --watch
    ```

**Interview Qs**

*   **Q: How do you compile TypeScript to JavaScript?**
    **A:** Using the TypeScript Compiler command: `tsc <filename>.ts`.

---

## 5. Setting Type

**Definition**: In TypeScript, you explicitly assign a type to a variable using a colon (`:`) followed by the type name. This is called a "type annotation".

**Example**:

```ts
let age: number = 20;
let name: string = "Zameer";
let isAdmin: boolean = true;
let marks: number[] = [90, 85, 70]; // An array of numbers
```

**Interview Qs**

*   **Q: How do you assign types to variables in TypeScript?**
    **A:** Using a colon (`:`) after the variable name, followed by the type. Example: `let age: number = 20;`.

---

## 6. Types in TypeScript

### a. Implicit vs Explicit

*   **Implicit (Type Inference)**: The type is automatically inferred by TypeScript based on the assigned value.
*   **Explicit (Type Annotation)**: The type is manually defined by the developer.

```ts
let x = 10; // Implicit: TypeScript infers x is a `number`
let y: string = "Hello"; // Explicit: We tell TypeScript y is a `string`
```

### b. `any` Type

*   **Definition**: The `any` type is a special type that opts out of type checking. It tells the compiler to trust that you know what you're doing.
*   **Explanation**: It is not recommended to use `any` as it defeats the purpose of TypeScript.

```ts
let data: any = 5;
data = "string"; // Allowed, no error
data = { key: "value" }; // Also allowed
```

### c. Losing Type Safety with `any`

*   **Explanation**: When a variable is of type `any`, TypeScript allows you to perform any operation on it without checking, which can lead to errors at runtime.

```ts
let info: any = "Hello";
info.toFixed(2); // ‚ùå Runtime error: info.toFixed is not a function
// TypeScript doesn't complain at compile time because `info` is `any`.
```

### d. `unknown`

*   **Definition**: The `unknown` type is a safer alternative to `any`. You can assign any value to an `unknown` variable, but you cannot use it until you perform a type check.
*   **Explanation**: This forces you to safely determine the type before performing operations.

```ts
let input: unknown = "hello";
if (typeof input === "string") {
  console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // ‚úÖ Safe to use here
}
```

### e. `never`

*   **Definition**: The `never` type represents a value that will never occur.
*   **Explanation**: It's typically used as the return type for functions that always throw an error or contain an infinite loop, as they never return a value.

```ts
function error(msg: string): never {
  throw new Error(msg);
}
```

### f. `enum`

*   **Definition**: An `enum` (enumeration) is a way to define a set of named constants, making your code more readable and less error-prone.
*   **Explanation**: By default, enums are number-based, starting at 0, but you can also assign string values.

```ts
enum Direction { Up, Down, Left, Right } // Up=0, Down=1, etc.
let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
```

### g. Tuple

*   **Definition**: A tuple is an array with a fixed number of elements where the type of each element is known.
*   **Explanation**: It's useful when you want to store a collection of values of different types in a specific order.

```ts
let person: [string, number] = ["Zameer", 25];
```

**Interview Qs & Answers**

*   **Q: Difference between `any` and `unknown`?**
    **A:** `any` disables all type checking. `unknown` is also a "catch-all" type, but it forces you to perform a type check before you can use the variable, making it much safer.
*   **Q: What is `never` used for?**
    **A:** It's the return type for functions that never return a value, such as those that always throw an error or have an infinite loop.
*   **Q: When to use a tuple vs an array?**
    **A:** Use a tuple for a fixed-size array where each element has a known and potentially different type (e.g., `[string, number]`). Use an array for a list of items of the same type (e.g., `string[]`).

---

## 7. Objects

### a. Readonly Property

*   **Definition**: The `readonly` modifier prevents a property of an object from being changed after it is initialized.

```ts
type User = { readonly id: number, name: string };
let user: User = { id: 1, name: "Ali" };
user.id = 2; // ‚ùå Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
```

### b. Methods in an Object Type

*   **Definition**: You can define methods (functions) that an object must have, including their parameters and return types.

```ts
type Car = {
  start(): void; // A method named 'start' that takes no arguments and returns nothing
};
let myCar: Car = {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine start");
  }
};
```

### c. Specific Value Types (Literal Types)

*   **Definition**: This is an example of a literal type combined with a union type. It restricts a variable to a specific, fixed set of values.

```ts
let role: "admin" | "user";
role = "admin"; // ‚úÖ
role = "guest"; // ‚ùå Error: Type '"guest"' is not assignable to type '"admin" | "user"'.
```

### d. Function Return Type

*   **Definition**: You can explicitly define the type of value a function is expected to return.

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number { // This function must return a number
  return a + b;
}
```

---

## 8. Type Alias

*   **Definition**: A type alias allows you to create a new name (an alias) for a type.
*   **Explanation**: This is useful for making complex types (like unions or objects) reusable and easier to read.

```ts
type ID = string | number;
let userId: ID = 101;
let productId: ID = "prod-123";
```

---

## 9. Union Type

*   **Definition**: A union type allows a variable to hold a value of one of several different types. It is declared using the pipe symbol (`|`).

```ts
let input: number | string;
input = 10;     // ‚úÖ
input = "ten";  // ‚úÖ
```

---

## 10. Type Intersection

*   **Definition**: An intersection type combines multiple types into one. The new type has all the properties of all the combined types. It is declared using the ampersand symbol (`&`).

```ts
type A = { name: string };
type B = { age: number };
type C = A & B;
let person: C = { name: "Zameer", age: 22 }; // Must have both name and age
```

---

## 11. Literal Types

*   **Definition**: A literal type restricts a variable to having one specific, exact value.
*   **Explanation**: They are most useful when combined with union types to create a set of allowed values.

```ts
let direction: "left" | "right" | "up";
direction = "left"; // ‚úÖ
direction = "down"; // ‚ùå Error
```

---

## 12. Nullable Type

*   **Definition**: A nullable type is a variable that can hold its specified type or `null`.
*   **Explanation**: This is achieved using a union type with `null`. It is useful for values that may not exist yet.

```ts
let age: number | null = null;
age = 25; // Can be assigned a number later
```

---

## 13. Optional Property, Element, & Call

### a. Optional Property

*   **Definition**: An optional property in an object or type is a property that does not need to be present. It is marked with a question mark (`?`).

```ts
type User = { name: string; age?: number }; // age is optional
const user1: User = { name: "Zameer" }; // ‚úÖ
const user2: User = { name: "Ali", age: 30 }; // ‚úÖ
```

### b. Optional Element

*   **Definition**: This example shows an array that can contain elements of a specific type or `undefined`. It is not a true "optional element" but a union type within an array.

```ts
let arr: (number | undefined)[] = [1, 2, undefined, 4];
```

### c. Optional Chaining / Call

*   **Definition**: Optional chaining (`?.`) allows you to safely access properties or call methods that might not exist. If the value before `?.` is `null` or `undefined`, the expression short-circuits and returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

```ts
type Person = { greet?: () => void };
let p: Person = {};
p.greet?.(); // Safe call: does nothing if greet is undefined
```

---

## 14. Interface

*   **Definition**: An interface is a contract that defines the shape of an object. It specifies the names and types of properties and methods that an object must have.

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

### a. Reopening an Interface (Declaration Merging)

*   **Definition**: Unlike a `type` alias, an `interface` can be defined multiple times. TypeScript will merge these definitions into a single interface.
*   **Explanation**: This is useful for extending interfaces from third-party libraries.

```ts
interface User {
  email: string;
}
// The User interface now has id, name, and email.
```

### b. Inheritance

*   **Definition**: An interface can inherit properties and methods from another interface using the `extends` keyword.

```ts
interface Employee extends User { // Employee has id, name, email
  salary: number;
}
```

---

## 15. Class

*   **Definition**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data (properties) and behavior (methods) for the object.

```ts
class Person {
  // Parameter properties: `public` and `private` automatically create and initialize properties
  constructor(public name: string, private age: number) {}
}
```

### a. Access Modifiers

*   `public` (default): Accessible from anywhere (inside the class, subclasses, and outside instances).
*   `private`: Accessible only from within the class where it is defined.
*   `protected`: Accessible from within the class and any subclasses that inherit from it.
*   `readonly`: A property that can only be set during initialization (in the constructor) and cannot be changed afterward.

### b. Getters/Setters

*   **Definition**: Getters and setters are special methods that provide read and write access to an object's private properties, allowing you to add logic during access or modification.

```ts
class Circle {
  private _radius: number = 0;
  get radius(): number { // Getter
    return this._radius;
  }
  set radius(value: number) { // Setter
    if (value < 0) throw new Error("Radius cannot be negative");
    this._radius = value;
  }
}
```

### c. Abstract Class

*   **Definition**: An abstract class is a base class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is meant to be inherited by other classes (subclasses).
*   **Explanation**: It can contain abstract methods (methods without an implementation) that must be implemented by any subclass.

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  abstract sound(): void; // Must be implemented by subclasses
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  sound() { // Implementation of the abstract method
    console.log("Bark");
  }
}
```

### d. Method Overriding

*   **Definition**: Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

```ts
class Parent {
  greet() { console.log("Hello"); }
}
class Child extends Parent {
  greet() { // This method overrides the parent's greet() method
    console.log("Hi");
  }
}
```

### e. Class vs Abstract Class

*   **Class**: A concrete blueprint that can be instantiated to create objects (e.g., `new Dog()`).
*   **Abstract Class**: A template for other classes. It cannot be instantiated itself and often defines a common interface for its subclasses.

---

## 16. Generics

*   **Definition**: Generics allow you to create **reusable, type-safe** components (like functions, classes, or interfaces) that can work with a variety of types instead of a single one. The type is specified as a parameter.
*   **Explanation**: They act like a placeholder (`<T>`) for a type that is determined when the component is used.

```ts
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}
let num = identity<number>(5);     // T is number
let str = identity<string>("hello"); // T is string
```

**Interview Qs & Answers**

*   **Q: What are generics in TypeScript?**
    **A:** Generics are a tool for creating reusable components that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one, while still maintaining type safety.
*   **Q: Difference between `any` and generics?**
    **A:** `any` completely disables type safety, allowing any operation. Generics preserve type safety by locking in a specific type when a function or class is used, ensuring that operations are valid for that type.








  Ah! Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî remembering the **SOLID principles** can be tricky at first. Let‚Äôs break them down with **easy tricks and examples** so you can **memorize and apply them confidently**.

---

# **SOLID Principles in TypeScript / OOP**

**S.O.L.I.D** is an acronym for **five design principles** that make your code **maintainable, flexible, and scalable**.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Definition:**
A class should have **only one reason to change** ‚Äî i.e., it should have **one responsibility**.

**Tip to Remember:** "One class = one job"

### **Example**

```ts
// ‚ùå Bad: Car class doing too many things
class Car {
  startEngine() { /*...*/ }
  saveToDatabase() { /*...*/ }
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Separate responsibilities
class Car {
  startEngine() { /*...*/ }
}

class CarRepository {
  save(car: Car) { /*...*/ }
}
```

> **Mnemonic:** ‚ÄúSRP ‚Üí Single Responsibility ‚Üí Single Job‚Äù

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Definition:**
Software entities should be **open for extension, closed for modification**.

**Tip to Remember:** "Extend, don‚Äôt modify"

### **Example**

```ts
interface Shape {
  area(): number;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
  constructor(public width: number, public height: number) {}
  area() { return this.width * this.height; }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
  constructor(public radius: number) {}
  area() { return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2; }
}

function totalArea(shapes: Shape[]): number {
  return shapes.reduce((sum, shape) => sum + shape.area(), 0);
}
```

> **Mnemonic:** "OCP ‚Üí Open to extension (add new shapes), Closed to modification (no need to change existing code)"

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Definition:**
Subtypes must be **replaceable for their base types** without breaking functionality.

**Tip to Remember:** "Derived classes should behave like the base class"

### **Example**

```ts
class Bird {
  fly() { console.log("Flying"); }
}

class Duck extends Bird {}
class Ostrich extends Bird {
  fly() { throw new Error("Can't fly"); } // ‚ùå violates LSP
}
```

> LSP is **about correct inheritance**. Subclasses should follow the same contract as parent.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Definition:**
Clients should **not be forced to depend on methods they don‚Äôt use**.

**Tip to Remember:** "Many small interfaces > One big interface"

### **Example**

```ts
// ‚ùå Big interface forcing unused methods
interface Machine {
  print(): void;
  scan(): void;
  fax(): void;
}

class Printer implements Machine {
  print() { console.log("Printing"); }
  scan() {}  // not needed
  fax() {}   // not needed
}

// ‚úÖ Split interfaces
interface PrinterMachine { print(): void; }
interface ScannerMachine { scan(): void; }

class SimplePrinter implements PrinterMachine {
  print() { console.log("Printing"); }
}
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Definition:**
High-level modules should **not depend on low-level modules**; both should depend on **abstractions (interfaces)**.

**Tip to Remember:** "Depend on abstractions, not concretions"

### **Example**

```ts
interface Database {
  save(data: string): void;
}

class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
  save(data: string) { console.log(`Saving "${data}" to MySQL`); }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(private db: Database) {}
  saveUser(name: string) {
    this.db.save(name);
  }
}

const db = new MySQLDatabase();
const service = new UserService(db);
service.saveUser("Zameer");
```

> ‚úÖ High-level `UserService` depends on **Database abstraction**, not concrete `MySQLDatabase`.

---

## **Memory Tricks**

| Principle | Easy Mnemonic                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| SRP       | One class = one job                 |
| OCP       | Open to extend, close to modify     |
| LSP       | Subtypes behave like base           |
| ISP       | Small interfaces, don't force       |
| DIP       | Depend on abstraction, not concrete |

**Shortcut to remember:** **‚ÄúS.O.L.I.D = Single, Open, Liskov, Interface, Dependency‚Äù**

---

If you want, I can make a **TypeScript SOLID Principles Cheat Sheet** with **short examples for each principle** that‚Äôs **super easy to memorize for interviews**.

Do you want me to do that?



Sure! Let‚Äôs break down **Dependency Injection (DI)** clearly and in an interview-friendly way.

---

## **Dependency Injection (DI) ‚Äî Definition**

**Dependency Injection** is a design pattern where **an object receives its dependencies from the outside** rather than creating them itself.

* In simple words: **‚ÄúGive an object what it needs, don‚Äôt make it find/create it itself.‚Äù**
* Helps make code **more modular, testable, and maintainable**.

---

## **Why use DI?**

1. **Decouples classes** ‚Üí reduces tight coupling.
2. **Easier to test** ‚Üí can inject mock dependencies.
3. **Flexible & maintainable** ‚Üí switch implementations without changing the dependent class.

---

## **Types of Dependency Injection**

1. **Constructor Injection** (most common)
2. **Setter Injection**
3. **Interface Injection**

---

## **TypeScript Example (Constructor Injection)**

```ts
// Dependency (abstraction)
interface Logger {
  log(message: string): void;
}

// Concrete implementation
class ConsoleLogger implements Logger {
  log(message: string): void {
    console.log("Log:", message);
  }
}

// High-level module depends on abstraction
class UserService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {} // dependency injected

  createUser(name: string) {
    // do some work
    this.logger.log(`User created: ${name}`);
  }
}

// Inject dependency from outside
const logger = new ConsoleLogger();
const userService = new UserService(logger);

userService.createUser("Zameer");
// Output: Log: User created: Zameer
```

‚úÖ **Explanation:**

* `UserService` does **not create the logger** itself.
* The **logger is injected** from outside via the constructor.
* Makes it easy to **swap the logger** (e.g., to a `FileLogger`) without modifying `UserService`.

---

## **Setter Injection Example**

```ts
class UserService2 {
  private logger!: Logger; // will be set later

  setLogger(logger: Logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
  }

  createUser(name: string) {
    this.logger.log(`User created: ${name}`);
  }
}

const service2 = new UserService2();
service2.setLogger(logger);
service2.createUser("Alice");
```

---

## **Key Benefits of DI**

1. Reduces **tight coupling** between classes.
2. Makes code **more reusable** and **extensible**.
3. Simplifies **unit testing** by injecting mocks/stubs.
4. Improves **readability & maintainability**.

---

### **Interview Tip:**

* DI is often mentioned with **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)**.
* **DIP says:** high-level modules should depend on **abstractions**, not concrete classes.
* DI is the **technique to implement DIP**.

---

If you want, I can make a **TypeScript DI Cheat Sheet** with **constructor injection, setter injection, interface injection, and real-world examples** for interviews.

Do you want me to do that?


Decorators in TypeScript are special functions that can be applied to **classes, methods, accessors, properties, or parameters** to add metadata or modify their behavior. They are widely used in frameworks like Angular. Based on where they can be applied, decorators can be classified as follows:

---

### **1. Class Decorators**

* **Purpose:** Applied to a class to modify or observe its behavior.
* **Syntax:** `@ClassDecorator`
* **Example:**

```ts
function Logger(constructor: Function) {
  console.log("Class created: ", constructor.name);
}

@Logger
class Person {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
}
// Output: Class created: Person
```

---

### **2. Property Decorators**

* **Purpose:** Applied to a class property to observe or modify metadata of that property.
* **Syntax:** `@PropertyDecorator`
* **Example:**

```ts
function ReadOnly(target: any, propertyKey: string) {
  Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, { writable: false });
}

class Car {
  @ReadOnly
  brand: string = "Toyota";
}

const car = new Car();
car.brand = "Honda"; // Error: Cannot assign to read-only property
```

---

### **3. Method Decorators**

* **Purpose:** Applied to a method to modify or observe the method behavior.
* **Syntax:** `@MethodDecorator`
* **Example:**

```ts
function Log(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Method ${propertyKey} called with args: ${args}`);
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class Calculator {
  @Log
  add(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
calc.add(2, 3);
// Output: Method add called with args: 2,3
```

---

### **4. Accessor Decorators**

* **Purpose:** Applied to getters or setters to observe or modify them.
* **Syntax:** `@AccessorDecorator`
* **Example:**

```ts
function Enumerable(value: boolean) {
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    descriptor.enumerable = value;
  };
}

class Person {
  private _age: number = 30;

  @Enumerable(false)
  get age() {
    return this._age;
  }
}
```

---

### **5. Parameter Decorators**

* **Purpose:** Applied to parameters of a class constructor or method to observe metadata.
* **Syntax:** `@ParameterDecorator`
* **Example:**

```ts
function LogParam(target: any, propertyKey: string, parameterIndex: number) {
  console.log(`Parameter at index ${parameterIndex} in method ${propertyKey} is decorated`);
}

class Person {
  greet(@LogParam name: string) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
  }
}
```

---

‚úÖ **Summary Table:**

| Decorator Type      | Applied To                   | Purpose                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Class Decorator     | Class                        | Modify/observe class behavior    |
| Property Decorator  | Class Property               | Modify/observe properties        |
| Method Decorator    | Class Method                 | Modify/observe methods           |
| Accessor Decorator  | Getter/Setter                | Modify/observe accessor behavior |
| Parameter Decorator | Method/Constructor Parameter | Observe parameter metadata       |

---

If you want, I can also explain **‚Äúdecorator factories‚Äù vs ‚Äúsimple decorators‚Äù** which is another important classification used in real-world TypeScript projects.

Do you want me to explain that too?
