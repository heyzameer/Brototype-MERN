Here are the React topics from the list, ordered from basic to advanced:

1.  One way data binding â€“ clarity
2.  Conditional rendering / dynamic rendering
3.  Controlled vs uncontrolled component
4.  Immutability of state
5.  Synthetic events
6.  Pass data from child to parent
7.  Purpose of using spread operator when update(react)
8.  PropTypes
9.  Hooks, custom hooks
10. Rules of using hooks / why can't hooks be used in conditions/branching statements
11. Lifecycle events in functional components / unmounting in functional component (`useEffect` basics, cleanup)
12. Limitations of functional components
13. Pure components / creating a pure component / React.memo
14. `useRef` (advantages, accessing uncontrolled elements, changing/modifying value, vs regular variable)
15. `useMemo`
16. `useMemo` dependency
17. `useLayoutEffect`

20. `forwardRef`
21. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
22. React portals
23. Error boundary
24. Suspense
25. `useLocation` (Related to React Router, common in React SPAs)
26. React optimization - learn more
27. React profiler
28. Drawbacks/limitations of `useMemo` & `react.memo` / `useCallback`
29. Automatic batching
30. `ReactDOMClient`
31. `ReactDOMServer`
32. Diffing algorithm / how diffing algorithm works
33. React Fiber
34. React concurrent
35. Latest features in React
36. How to prevent entire right click events from the react app

- When and why do we need `lazy()`?
- What is `suspense`?
- Why we got this `error`: A component was suspended while responding to `synchronous input`. This will cause the `UI` to be replaced with a `loading indicator`. To `fix this`, `updates that suspend` should be wrapped with `start transition`? How does `suspense fix` this error?
- `Advantages and Disadvantages` of using this `code splitting pattern`?
- When `do we and why do we need suspense`?



- What is prop drilling?
- What is lifting the state up?
- What are Context Provider and Context Consumer?
- If you don't pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?
