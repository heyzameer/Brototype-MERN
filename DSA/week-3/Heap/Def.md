### ❖ **Definition and Properties of Heaps**

#### ✅ **Definition of Heap:**

A **Heap** is a specialized **binary tree** that satisfies the **heap property**. It is commonly used to implement **priority queues**.

There are two types of heaps:

1. **Max-Heap**: In a max-heap, the value of each node is **greater than or equal** to the values of its children. So, the **maximum value** is always at the **root**.
2. **Min-Heap**: In a min-heap, the value of each node is **less than or equal** to the values of its children. Thus, the **minimum value** is at the **root**.

#### ✅ **Heap is always a Complete Binary Tree:**

* This means all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from **left to right**.

---

### ❖ **Properties of Heaps:**

1. **Shape Property**:

   * A heap must be a **complete binary tree**. This ensures optimal use of space and allows efficient array representation.

2. **Heap Property**:

   * For **max-heap**: `parent >= left child` and `parent >= right child`
   * For **min-heap**: `parent <= left child` and `parent <= right child`

3. **Height of Heap**:

   * The height of a heap with `n` nodes is `O(log n)` because it’s a complete binary tree.

4. **Array Representation**:

   * A heap can be efficiently stored as an **array** where:

     * For a node at index `i`:

       * Left child → `2i + 1`
       * Right child → `2i + 2`
       * Parent → `floor((i - 1) / 2)`

5. **Insertion**:

   * Insert the new element at the **next available position** to maintain shape property.
   * **Heapify up**: Compare with parent and swap until the heap property is restored.
   * Time complexity: **O(log n)**

6. **Deletion (typically of root)**:

   * Replace the root with the **last element**, remove the last element.
   * **Heapify down**: Swap with the larger/smaller child in a max/min heap.
   * Time complexity: **O(log n)**

7. **Accessing Max/Min**:

   * Access the root (index 0 of array).
   * Time complexity: **O(1)**

---

### ❖ **Use Cases of Heaps:**

* **Priority Queues** – scheduling tasks, bandwidth management.
* **Heap Sort** – sorting algorithm using a heap structure.
* **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – for shortest paths using min-heap.
* **Median Finder** – using two heaps (max-heap and min-heap).
* **Top-K elements** – efficiently retrieve largest or smallest `k` items.

---




### ❖ **Heapification Methods**

**Heapification** is the process of rearranging elements in a binary tree (or array) to satisfy the **heap property**—whether it's a **Max-Heap** or **Min-Heap**.

There are **two primary methods** for heapifying:

* **Top-Down Heapification**
* **Bottom-Up Heapification**

---

### ➢ **Top-Down Heapification (also called Down-Heap or Sift-Down)**

#### ✅ **Definition:**

Top-Down Heapification is used during **deletion**, especially when we remove the root (maximum/minimum) from the heap.

#### 🔧 **How it works:**

1. Replace the root node with the last node.
2. Compare the new root with its children.
3. If the heap property is violated, **swap** it with the appropriate child (larger child in Max-Heap, smaller in Min-Heap).
4. Repeat the process down the tree (recursively or iteratively) until the heap is valid again.

#### ⏱️ **Time Complexity:**

* **O(log n)** — the height of the tree.

#### 📌 **Use Case:**

* After **removing the root** in heap operations like `extractMax()` or `extractMin()`.

#### 🔁 **Example (Max-Heap):**

```text
Before Deletion:
       50
      /  \
    30    40
   / \    /
 10  20  35

After deleting root (50), we move last element (35) to root:

       35
      /  \
    30    40

Now, 35 < 40 → Swap → Heap property restored.

       40
      /  \
    30    35
```

---

### ➢ **Bottom-Up Heapification (also called Up-Heap or Sift-Up)**

#### ✅ **Definition:**

Bottom-Up Heapification is used during **insertion** when a new element is added to the heap.

#### 🔧 **How it works:**

1. Insert the new element at the **next available position** (to maintain the complete binary tree).
2. Compare the new node with its parent.
3. If the heap property is violated, **swap** it with the parent.
4. Continue this process **up the tree** until the heap property is restored.

#### ⏱️ **Time Complexity:**

* **O(log n)** — the height of the tree.

#### 📌 **Use Case:**

* After **inserting a new element** into the heap.

#### 🔁 **Example (Min-Heap):**

```text
Insert 5 into this Min-Heap:

       10
      /  \
    20    15

Inserted at next position:

       10
      /  \
    20    15
   /
  5

Now 5 < 20 → Swap

       10
      /  \
     5    15
   /
  20

Now 5 < 10 → Swap

       5
      /  \
    10    15
   /
  20
```

### 💡 **Summary:**

| Method    | Triggered When? | Direction   | Use Case                    | Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Top-Down  | After Deletion  | Root → Leaf | `extractMax()`, `heapify()` | O(log n)   |
| Bottom-Up | After Insertion | Leaf → Root | `insert()`, `buildHeap()`   | O(log n)   |

Here’s a clear explanation of **Heap Sort**, covering its **concept**, **algorithm**, **time complexity**, and **applications**:

---

## **Heap Sort**

### ❖ **Concept and Algorithm**

**Heap Sort** is a **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that uses the **heap data structure**—specifically a **binary heap** (usually a Max-Heap for ascending sort or Min-Heap for descending sort).

The main idea is:

1. Convert the input array into a **heap** (heapify).
2. Repeatedly extract the **maximum (or minimum) element** from the heap.
3. Place the extracted element at the end of the array.
4. Re-heapify the remaining heap.

This process ensures that the array gets sorted.

---

### ✅ **Steps of the Heap Sort Algorithm (for Ascending Order using Max-Heap):**

#### 1. **Build Max-Heap**

* Start from the last non-leaf node and apply `heapify()` to all nodes.
* This ensures the max element is at the root.

#### 2. **Heap Sort**

* Swap the root (max value) with the last element.
* Reduce the heap size by 1.
* Heapify the root again to restore the heap property.
* Repeat until the heap size becomes 1.

---

### 📌 **Heap Sort Example:**

Given array: `[4, 10, 3, 5, 1]`

**Step 1: Build Max-Heap →** `[10, 5, 3, 4, 1]`
**Step 2: Swap max with last →** `[1, 5, 3, 4, 10]`
**Heapify →** `[5, 4, 3, 1, 10]`
**Swap again →** `[1, 4, 3, 5, 10]`
… repeat until sorted → `[1, 3, 4, 5, 10]`

---

### ❖ **Time Complexity: O(n log n)**

| Operation       | Time           |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Build Heap      | O(n)           |
| Heapify n times | O(log n)       |
| Total           | **O(n log n)** |

* **Best, Average, Worst Case**: All are **O(n log n)**
* **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (in-place)

---

### ❖ **Applications of Heap Sort**

1. **In-place Sorting**:

   * Doesn’t require additional memory like Merge Sort.
   * Useful when memory is constrained.

2. **Priority Queues**:

   * Based on heaps—used in job scheduling and OS task management.

3. **Real-Time Systems**:

   * Time guarantees due to O(n log n) performance in all cases.

4. **Embedded Systems**:

   * When deterministic execution time is needed.

5. **External Sorting**:

   * Works well with large datasets using memory-efficient heaps.

---

### ✅ **Key Advantages:**

* No need for extra memory.
* Better than quicksort for datasets with worst-case guarantees.
* Consistent performance across all cases.

---



Here's a clear explanation and implementation of **Heap Operations** for both **Max-Heap** and **Min-Heap**, including **insertion**, **deletion**, and **peek**.

---

## ✅ **Heap Operations Overview**

A **heap** is a **complete binary tree** stored as an array, with two main types:

* **Max-Heap**: Parent node is always **greater than or equal** to its children.
* **Min-Heap**: Parent node is always **less than or equal** to its children.

---

## 📌 **Operations to Implement**

1. **Insertion**
2. **Deletion** (of root)
3. **Peek** (get the root value)

---

## 🔷 **Max-Heap Implementation in JavaScript**

```javascript
class MaxHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  insert(value) {
    this.heap.push(value);
    this._heapifyUp();
  }

  delete() {
    if (this.heap.length === 0) return null;
    const max = this.heap[0];
    const end = this.heap.pop();
    if (this.heap.length > 0) {
      this.heap[0] = end;
      this._heapifyDown();
    }
    return max;
  }

  peek() {
    return this.heap.length ? this.heap[0] : null;
  }

  _heapifyUp() {
    let index = this.heap.length - 1;
    while (index > 0) {
      let parent = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
      if (this.heap[index] <= this.heap[parent]) break;
      [this.heap[index], this.heap[parent]] = [this.heap[parent], this.heap[index]];
      index = parent;
    }
  }

  _heapifyDown() {
    let index = 0;
    const length = this.heap.length;
    const element = this.heap[0];

    while (true) {
      let left = 2 * index + 1;
      let right = 2 * index + 2;
      let largest = index;

      if (left < length && this.heap[left] > this.heap[largest]) {
        largest = left;
      }
      if (right < length && this.heap[right] > this.heap[largest]) {
        largest = right;
      }

      if (largest === index) break;

      [this.heap[index], this.heap[largest]] = [this.heap[largest], this.heap[index]];
      index = largest;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🔶 **Min-Heap Implementation in JavaScript**

```javascript
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  insert(value) {
    this.heap.push(value);
    this._heapifyUp();
  }

  delete() {
    if (this.heap.length === 0) return null;
    const min = this.heap[0];
    const end = this.heap.pop();
    if (this.heap.length > 0) {
      this.heap[0] = end;
      this._heapifyDown();
    }
    return min;
  }

  peek() {
    return this.heap.length ? this.heap[0] : null;
  }

  _heapifyUp() {
    let index = this.heap.length - 1;
    while (index > 0) {
      let parent = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
      if (this.heap[index] >= this.heap[parent]) break;
      [this.heap[index], this.heap[parent]] = [this.heap[parent], this.heap[index]];
      index = parent;
    }
  }

  _heapifyDown() {
    let index = 0;
    const length = this.heap.length;

    while (true) {
      let left = 2 * index + 1;
      let right = 2 * index + 2;
      let smallest = index;

      if (left < length && this.heap[left] < this.heap[smallest]) {
        smallest = left;
      }
      if (right < length && this.heap[right] < this.heap[smallest]) {
        smallest = right;
      }

      if (smallest === index) break;

      [this.heap[index], this.heap[smallest]] = [this.heap[smallest], this.heap[index]];
      index = smallest;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 📝 **Summary**

* **MaxHeap**: Extracts the largest element first.
* **MinHeap**: Extracts the smallest element first.
* **Insertion**: Insert at end and bubble up.
* **Deletion**: Replace root with last element, then heapify down.
* **Peek**: Return the root value.






To perform **heap sort on strings**, you can sort an array of strings (e.g., names, words, etc.) in **lexicographical order** using the **heap sort algorithm**. The process is the same as heap sort on numbers, but instead of comparing numbers, we compare strings.

---

## ✅ **Heap Sort for Strings (Lexicographic Sort)**

### 🎯 Goal:

Sort strings alphabetically using **heap sort** (typically using **max-heap** for ascending order).

---

### 🧠 Lexicographical Comparison:

In JavaScript, comparing strings with `>` and `<` works alphabetically:

```js
"apple" < "banana"   // true
"zebra" > "cat"      // true
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Heap Sort for Strings in JavaScript**:

```js
function heapSortStrings(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;

  // Build max heap
  for (let i = Math.floor(n / 2) - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    heapify(arr, n, i);
  }

  // Extract elements one by one
  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    [arr[0], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[0]];
    heapify(arr, i, 0);
  }

  return arr;
}

// Heapify subtree rooted at index i for strings
function heapify(arr, n, i) {
  let largest = i;
  let left = 2 * i + 1;
  let right = 2 * i + 2;

  if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest]) largest = left;
  if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest]) largest = right;

  if (largest !== i) {
    [arr[i], arr[largest]] = [arr[largest], arr[i]];
    heapify(arr, n, largest);
  }
}
```

---

### 🧪 Example:

```js
let names = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"];
console.log(heapSortStrings(names));
// Output: ["apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi", "orange"]
```

---

### 📌 Note:

* For **descending order**, just build a **min-heap** instead of a max-heap.
* Works with strings of different lengths.

---

Would you like a version of this in another language (like Python or Java), or heap sort on an array of **objects** (e.g., sorting by `name` or `title`)?













Here’s a complete explanation of the **Heap Sort algorithm** with its steps, pseudocode, JavaScript implementation, and key points:

---

## ✅ **Heap Sort Algorithm**

Heap Sort is a **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that uses a **heap data structure**—usually a **Max-Heap** for ascending order sort.

---

### 🔧 **Concept**:

1. **Build a Max-Heap** from the input array.
2. **Swap the root (maximum element)** with the last element in the array.
3. **Reduce the heap size by 1** and **heapify the root** again to maintain the max-heap.
4. Repeat steps 2–3 until the heap size is 1.

---

### 🧠 Why Max-Heap?

Because the maximum element is always at the root (index `0`), which makes it easy to extract the largest element and place it at the end of the array.

---

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:

* **Building the heap:** `O(n)`
* **Heapify (per element):** `O(log n)`
* **Total time:** `O(n log n)`

---

### 📘 Pseudocode:

```
HEAP_SORT(arr):
    BUILD_MAX_HEAP(arr)
    for i from n-1 to 1:
        SWAP arr[0] with arr[i]
        heap_size -= 1
        MAX_HEAPIFY(arr, 0)
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 JavaScript Implementation:

```js
function heapSort(arr) {
  let n = arr.length;

  // Step 1: Build max heap
  for (let i = Math.floor(n / 2) - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    heapify(arr, n, i);
  }

  // Step 2: Heap sort
  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    [arr[0], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[0]]; // Swap root with end
    heapify(arr, i, 0); // Heapify reduced heap
  }

  return arr;
}

// Heapify subtree rooted at index i
function heapify(arr, n, i) {
  let largest = i;
  let left = 2 * i + 1;
  let right = 2 * i + 2;

  if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest]) largest = left;
  if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest]) largest = right;

  if (largest !== i) {
    [arr[i], arr[largest]] = [arr[largest], arr[i]];
    heapify(arr, n, largest);
  }
}
```

---

### 🧪 Example:

```js
let arr = [4, 10, 3, 5, 1];
console.log("Sorted array:", heapSort(arr));
// Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]
```

---

### 📌 Applications of Heap Sort:

* Sorting large data sets with guaranteed `O(n log n)` worst-case time.
* Embedded systems where recursion stack overhead from QuickSort is unwanted.
* Used in **priority queues** where max/min retrieval is needed.

| Operation          | Complexity | Explanation                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Building Heap      | O(n)       | Bottom-up heapify is linear                              |
| Heapify (per node) | O(log n)   | Heapify takes time proportional to tree height           |
| Total Sorting      | O(n log n) | `n` elements extracted, each takes `log n` to re-heapify |

**➡ Final Time Complexity: O(n log n)** (Best, Average, Worst cases)

| Total     | O(1)       | Except input array, no extra space |

---

## ✅ 2. **Applications of Heap Sort & Heap Data Structure**

### 🔹 A. Heap Sort Applications

1. **Sorting large datasets** where `O(n log n)` is acceptable and memory usage must be minimal.
2. **Embedded systems** where no recursion or additional space is preferred (in-place sort).
3. **External sorting** (when data doesn't fit in memory): useful for partial sorting using heap in memory.

---

### 🔹 B. Min/Max Heap Applications (not just sorting)

#### **Min Heap**:

* **Priority Queue**: Always gives smallest element quickly (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).
* **Merge K sorted arrays/lists**: Always pick smallest element from heads.
* **Job scheduling**: Pick the least time-consuming task first.

#### **Max Heap**:

* **Order statistics**: Find K largest/smallest elements.
* **Heap-based median finding**: Use max heap for left half, min heap for right half.
* **Load balancing**: Assign tasks to machines with max availability.
