### ⏱️ Time Complexity & 💾 Space Complexity — Explained Simply

---

### ✅ **1. Time Complexity**

**Definition:**
Time complexity tells you **how fast** an algorithm runs as the input size `n` increases.
It measures the **number of operations**, not actual time in seconds.


The rate at which the time taken increases with respect top teh input size
---

#### 🔹 Common Time Complexities:

| Notation   | Name         | Example Use Case                |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| O(1)       | Constant     | Accessing array index           |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic  | Binary search                   |
| O(n)       | Linear       | Loop through array              |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge sort, quicksort (avg)     |
| O(n²)      | Quadratic    | Nested loops (e.g. bubble sort) |
| O(2ⁿ)      | Exponential  | Recursive Fibonacci             |

---

#### 🔸 Example:

```js
function printFirst(arr) {
  console.log(arr[0]);  // O(1)
}

function printAll(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]); // O(n)
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ **2. Space Complexity**

**Definition:**
Space complexity is the amount of **memory (RAM)** an algorithm uses during execution, depending on the input size `n`.

It includes:

* Input space
* Auxiliary space (temporary variables, stack, etc.)

---

#### 🔹 Common Space Complexities:

| Notation | Meaning         | Example                    |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| O(1)     | Constant space  | No extra memory used       |
| O(n)     | Linear space    | Stores output in new array |
| O(n²)    | Quadratic space | 2D matrix or grid storage  |

---

#### 🔸 Example:

```js
function sum(arr) {
  let total = 0;         // O(1) space
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    total += arr[i];
  }
  return total;
}
```

This function uses **O(1)** space even if the input is large.

### 📊 Asymptotic Analysis – **Big-O vs Θ (Theta) vs Ω (Omega)**

Asymptotic analysis helps us understand how an algorithm behaves as the input size (`n`) becomes very large.

Asymptotic Analysis is used to describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space, as the input size (n) grows large. It helps compare algorithms without depending on machine or code specifics.

---

### ✅ **1. Big-O (O)** — Worst Case

* **Meaning:** Upper bound
* Describes the **maximum** time (or space) the algorithm will take
* Most commonly used in coding interviews and performance analysis

🔸 **You say:**

> “It **won’t take more than** this much time.”

**Example:**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Time: O(n) — at most n steps
```

---

### ✅ **2. Omega (Ω)** — Best Case

* **Meaning:** Lower bound
* Describes the **minimum** time an algorithm will take
* Helps analyze **best-case performance**

🔸 **You say:**

> “It will take **at least** this much time.”

**Example:**

```js
function searchFirst(arr, target) {
  return arr[0] === target;  // Best case: found at start
}
// Time: Ω(1)
```

---

### ✅ **3. Theta (Θ)** — Tight Bound

* **Meaning:** Both lower and upper bound
* Describes the **exact running time** when best, average, and worst cases are similar

🔸 **You say:**

> “It will **always** take about this much time.”

**Example:**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Time: Θ(n) — exactly n steps for any input
```

---

### 📌 Summary Table:

| Notation    | Describes   | Represents                | Says          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| **O(f(n))** | Worst-case  | Maximum time/space needed | "At most..."  |
| **Ω(f(n))** | Best-case   | Minimum time/space needed | "At least..." |
| **Θ(f(n))** | Tight bound | Exact time/space behavior | "Exactly..."  |

---

### 📈 Visual Intuition:

Imagine a function's actual run time is a line:

* **Big-O** is the ceiling (won't go above)
* **Omega** is the floor (won't go below)
* **Theta** is the actual straight path it usually follows

### **Basics of Memory Allocation and Memory Leak in JavaScript**

**Memory Allocation in JavaScript:**
In JavaScript, memory management is mostly **automatic**. When you create variables, objects, or functions, the JavaScript engine automatically allocates memory for them. For example:

```js
let name = "Zameer"; // Memory is automatically allocated for this string
let arr = [1, 2, 3]; // Memory is allocated for the array and its elements
```

JavaScript uses a **Garbage Collector** that automatically frees memory when objects are no longer in use. This process is based on **reachability**—if a value can no longer be accessed, it’s considered garbage and is collected.

---

**Memory Leak in JavaScript:**
Even though JS has automatic memory management, **memory leaks** can still happen if references to unused objects are unintentionally kept. This means the garbage collector won't clean them up, and memory usage will grow unnecessarily.

**Common Causes of Memory Leaks:**

1. **Global variables not cleaned up**

   ```js
   someBigObject = {}; // Without let/const, becomes a global variable
   ```
2. **Forgotten timers or intervals**

   ```js
   setInterval(() => {
     // Keeps running, even if not needed
   }, 1000);
   ```
3. **Event listeners not removed**

   ```js
   element.addEventListener('click', handler);
   // If not removed, even after element is removed from DOM, memory leaks occur
   ```
4. **Closures holding references**

   ```js
   function leaky() {
     let largeData = new Array(1000000).fill('leak');
     return function () {
       console.log(largeData[0]);
     };
   }
   ```

---

**Conclusion:**
JavaScript handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically, but developers should still write clean, optimized code and avoid patterns that cause memory leaks—especially in long-running apps like SPAs (Single Page Applications).









**Basics of Memory Allocation and Memory Leak**

**Memory Allocation:**
Memory allocation is the process of reserving a portion of computer memory for storing data and program instructions during runtime. It can be of two types:

* **Static Allocation:** Memory is allocated at compile time (e.g., global variables, arrays with fixed size).
* **Dynamic Allocation:** Memory is allocated at runtime using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, or `new`, and needs to be manually freed using `free` or `delete`.

**Memory Leak:**
A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but fails to release it after use. As a result, the unused memory remains occupied and cannot be reused, eventually leading to reduced performance or system crashes. This is common in languages like C and C++ if the programmer forgets to deallocate dynamically allocated memory.

**Example:**

```c
int* ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
// If 'free(ptr);' is not called later, this causes a memory leak.
```

Understanding proper memory allocation and avoiding leaks is essential for building efficient and reliable software.









Here’s a clear and short explanation for both topics:

---

### ✅ **How to Prevent Memory Leaks in JavaScript**

Even though JavaScript has **automatic garbage collection**, memory leaks can still happen. Here’s how to prevent them:

#### 🔹 1. **Avoid Unused Global Variables**

```js
window.leak = largeData; // ❌ creates global reference
```

Use `let`, `const` to keep variables scoped.

#### 🔹 2. **Clear Timers and Intervals**

```js
let timer = setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
// ✅ clear it when not needed
clearInterval(timer);
```

#### 🔹 3. **Remove Event Listeners**

```js
element.addEventListener("click", handler);
// ✅ remove when no longer needed
element.removeEventListener("click", handler);
```

#### 🔹 4. **Avoid Unused References in Closures**

```js
function leaky() {
  let largeData = new Array(1000000).fill('leak');
  return () => console.log(largeData[0]);
}
```

Keep closures lean and clean.

#### 🔹 5. **Use Chrome DevTools > Memory Tab**

To check for retained objects and memory leaks in your app.

---

### ✅ **What is Static Memory Allocation?**

**Static memory allocation** means memory is reserved **at compile time**, and it **cannot change during program execution**.

#### 📦 Example in C:

```c
int arr[100]; // Allocated at compile time
```

JavaScript does **not** use static memory allocation directly, but it's a key concept in lower-level languages like C and C++.

---

### ✅ **Advantages of Static Memory Allocation**

| Advantage                              | Explanation                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 **Fast access**                     | No need to request memory at runtime         |
| 🔹 **Memory-efficient for small data** | No runtime overhead of dynamic allocation    |
| 🔹 **Simpler implementation**          | No risk of memory leaks or dangling pointers |
| 🔹 **Compile-time safety**             | Errors can be caught early (size fixed)      |
