Of course. I have integrated the additional colleges—Vidya Vardhaka College of Engineering (Mysore), REVA University, The Oxford College of Engineering, and H.K.B.K. College of Engineering—into the previous ranking.

The ranking is updated based on the same methodology: overall reputation, placement strength (especially for core mechanical), autonomous/university status, and value for money.

This ranking prioritizes:
*   **Core Company Visits:** The likelihood of companies from the manufacturing, automotive, R&D, and thermal sectors visiting the campus.
*   **Quality of Roles:** The probability of securing roles like Design Engineer, Production Engineer, or R&D Trainee, not just IT support roles.
*   **Industry Connections & Location:** Proximity to industrial hubs and established relationships with core companies.
*   **Brand Leverage:** The ability of the university/college brand to attract top-tier recruiters.

### Re-Ranked List Based Exclusively on Mechanical Placements

### Tier A: Strongest Prospects for Core Placements

These institutions have a distinct advantage due to brand reputation, strategic location, or strong university-level placement cells that actively pursue core companies.

1.  **Dayananda Sagar University (DSU)**
    *   **Placement Focus:** DSU benefits immensely from the powerful **Dayananda Sagar Group (DSGI)** brand and placement ecosystem, which includes the highly-reputed DSCE. They have long-standing ties with automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing companies. This synergy gives their students a significant edge in accessing a wide range of core opportunities.

2.  **REVA University**
    *   **Placement Focus:** As a large and well-funded private university, REVA has a highly proactive and resourceful central placement cell. They have the scale to attract a diverse portfolio of companies, including a good number of core mechanical and manufacturing firms like Bosch, L&T, and others. Their focus on modern specializations also appeals to R&D centers.

3.  **Acharya Institute of Technology (AIT)**
    *   **Placement Focus:** AIT has a unique and powerful advantage for Mechanical Engineering: its **location next to the Peenya Industrial Area**, one of the largest industrial hubs in Southeast Asia. This provides students with unparalleled access to internships and placements in a vast number of Small, Medium, and Large-Scale Enterprises (SMEs & LSEs) in the manufacturing and machine tools sector. This practical, industry-adjacent environment is invaluable for core placements.

---

### Tier B: Good & Consistent Core Opportunities

These are reputable autonomous colleges and universities where students can find decent core placements, though the volume and variety might be slightly less than Tier A.

4.  **Cambridge Institutute of Technology, K.R.Puram (CIT)**
    *   **Placement Focus:** CIT is a well-regarded autonomous college with a good track record. Its location near the Whitefield and K.R. Puram industrial areas provides access to automotive, electronics manufacturing, and IT hardware companies. They have consistent core company visits.

5.  **PRESIDENCY University**
    *   **Placement Focus:** Similar to REVA, Presidency leverages its status as a major private university to attract recruiters. While their overall placements are strong, their network for core mechanical companies is still developing compared to more established names like the DSGI group. However, they provide a good platform with many opportunities.

6.  **Global Academy of Technology (GAT)**
    *   **Placement Focus:** A solid autonomous college with a dedicated placement cell. They secure placements in a mix of core and IT companies. While not at the top for core placements, it offers a reliable platform and consistent results for deserving students.

7.  **ALLIANCE University**
    *   **Placement Focus:** While primarily famous for its business school, Alliance has a decent engineering program. Its placement cell is professional, but its core engineering network is not as extensive as its IT and management networks. Students will find opportunities, but they may need to compete with a larger pool for fewer core roles.

---

### Tier C: Challenging for Core Placements (IT-Dominant)

In these colleges, on-campus core mechanical placements are limited. The vast majority of opportunities will come from IT service companies (like TCS, Wipro, Infosys) hiring mechanical graduates for tech roles. Students aiming for core jobs will likely need to rely heavily on their own efforts and off-campus applications.

8.  **The Oxford College of Engineering, Bangalore**
    *   **Placement Focus:** An old and established name, but its placements are now heavily dominated by IT service companies. The number of core mechanical companies visiting the campus is low.

9.  **East Point College of Engineering & Technology, Bangalore**
    *   **Placement Focus:** As an autonomous college, it has some industry connections, but placements are heavily skewed towards IT. Core opportunities are sporadic.

10. **East West Institute Of Technology, Bangalore**
    *   **Placement Focus:** Similar profile to East Point. A majority of mechanical students get placed in the IT sector.

11. **K S School of Engineering & Management (KSSEM) & Sai Vidya Institute of Technology (SVIT)**
    *   **Placement Focus:** These colleges are relatively newer and are still building their industry networks. On-campus core placements are challenging to come by. The placement cell primarily facilitates mass recruitment drives by IT companies.

12. **H.K.B.K.College of Engineering, Bangalore**
    *   **Placement Focus:** This college faces the most significant challenge in attracting core mechanical companies from this list. Students should expect very limited on-campus core opportunities and prepare for off-campus job hunting.
